Linda, what's your classroom in England like? Is it big?

00:06.000 --> 00:13.000
Yes, it's really big. There are 30 students in my class.

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
How many students are there in your class in Beijing?

00:18.000 --> 00:24.000
There are 40 students, 20 girls and 20 boys.

What's in your classroom? Is there a lot of furniture?

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
Yes, there is.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
Are there computers on everyone's desk?

00:35.000 --> 00:41.000
No, there aren't. But there is a computer on the teacher's desk.

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
Oh, are there any pictures on the classroom walls?

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
Yes, there are. At the front of the classroom.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
And is there a map of the world?

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
No, there isn't. There's a map of England.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
There's a map of the world in our classroom.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
But there aren't any pictures on our walls.

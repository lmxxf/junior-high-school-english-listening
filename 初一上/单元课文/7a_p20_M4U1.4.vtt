Betty, please help me make a shopping list.

00:03.840 --> 00:05.440
Yes, Mom.

00:05.440 --> 00:07.200
What have we got?

00:07.200 --> 00:13.600
We've got some chicken, apples, and oranges.

00:13.600 --> 00:20.240
And we've got some tea, tomatoes, and coffee.

00:20.240 --> 00:28.400
But we haven't got any cola, beans, beef, carrots,

00:28.400 --> 00:31.200
juice, and milk.

00:31.200 --> 00:37.200
And we haven't got any potatoes and any water.

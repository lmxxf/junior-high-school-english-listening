00:00.000 --> 00:04.300
Tony, let's go shopping for food and drink.

00:04.300 --> 00:07.800
Now, we haven't got any meat.

00:07.800 --> 00:10.300
Let's get some chicken.

00:10.300 --> 00:11.800
Okay.

00:11.800 --> 00:14.300
Have we got any chocolate?

00:14.300 --> 00:16.800
Yes, we have.

00:16.800 --> 00:20.600
Too much chocolate isn't good for you.

00:20.600 --> 00:23.100
Let's get some fruit.

00:23.100 --> 00:25.300
What kind of fruit?

00:25.300 --> 00:27.000
Apples.

00:27.400 --> 00:31.000
No, we've got lots of apples.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.100
We haven't got any oranges.

00:34.100 --> 00:36.400
So, let's get some.

00:36.400 --> 00:37.800
Okay.

00:37.800 --> 00:40.900
How about some orange juice?

00:40.900 --> 00:43.700
Yes, good idea.

00:43.700 --> 00:45.500
And coffee.

00:45.500 --> 00:48.000
Let's get some for your mum.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
She hasn't got any coffee.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.200
All right.

00:52.300 --> 00:54.500
Some coffee for mum.

00:54.500 --> 00:57.100
And some cola for me.

00:57.100 --> 01:00.000
I haven't got any cola.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.100
No, cola.

01:02.100 --> 01:05.100
Cola is bad for you.

01:05.100 --> 01:08.100
How about some tea?

01:08.100 --> 01:10.600
Ah, too bad.

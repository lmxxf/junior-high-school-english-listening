00:00.000 --> 00:02.840
My school day.

00:02.840 --> 00:07.280
Hi, I'm Alex Greenhall.

00:07.280 --> 00:14.180
I'm 13 and I go to Park School in Oxford, England.

00:14.180 --> 00:21.200
I go to school on weekdays, but not on Saturday and Sunday.

00:21.200 --> 00:24.520
This is my school day.

00:24.520 --> 00:31.600
I get up at half past seven in the morning and then have breakfast.

00:31.600 --> 00:35.760
My school is next to my house.

00:35.760 --> 00:42.000
I go to school at half past eight and see my friends.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.360
We start work at nine o'clock.

00:46.360 --> 00:50.240
We have three lessons in the morning.

00:50.240 --> 00:54.880
My favourite subject is art.

00:54.880 --> 01:03.280
At eleven o'clock we have a break in the playground and I talk to my friends.

01:03.280 --> 01:11.320
They go to the playground and play football, but I don't like football.

01:11.320 --> 01:17.040
We have lunch in the dining hall at half past twelve.

01:17.040 --> 01:20.120
I like school lunch.

01:20.120 --> 01:27.640
We have meat and rice with vegetables or hamburgers.

01:27.640 --> 01:32.720
I drink juice or water.

01:32.720 --> 01:38.560
We start lessons in the afternoon at half past one.

01:38.560 --> 01:42.640
We have two lessons in the afternoon.

01:42.640 --> 01:48.200
Then we go home at half past three.

01:48.200 --> 01:55.480
In the evening I watch TV and have dinner with my family.

01:55.480 --> 02:00.520
I do my homework and go to bed at ten o'clock.

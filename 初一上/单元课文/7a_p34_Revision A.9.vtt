Betty, are you busy on Thursday?

00:03.700 --> 00:10.100
On Thursday, I get up at 7 and go to school at 7.30.

00:10.100 --> 00:12.700
Do you start lessons at 8?

00:12.700 --> 00:15.700
Yes, we started at 8.

00:15.700 --> 00:18.100
What do you do at break?

00:18.100 --> 00:22.100
We have 20 minutes break at 10.10.

00:22.100 --> 00:24.100
I talk with a friend.

00:24.100 --> 00:26.200
When is your lunch?

00:26.200 --> 00:28.500
It's at 12.30.

00:28.500 --> 00:31.500
I have half an hour for lunch.

00:31.500 --> 00:35.500
I do some work at the library at 1 o'clock.

00:35.500 --> 00:38.000
You go home at 3.40?

00:38.000 --> 00:39.500
That's early.

00:39.500 --> 00:43.500
Yes, but I do sports at 4.15.

00:43.500 --> 00:47.500
Oh, that's why you are so busy.

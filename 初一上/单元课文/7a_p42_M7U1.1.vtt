This is our computer.

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
Tony, can you help me please?

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
Yes, Miss Lee.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
What's this in English?

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
That's the screen.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
Okay.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
And this?

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
That's the keyboard.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
That's right.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
And what's this?

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
The mouse.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Good.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
And how does it work, Doming?

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
First, connect the screen to the computer.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
Okay.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
Good.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
What's next?

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
Connect the keyboard and the mouse to the computer.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Good.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
And finally?

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
Turn on the computer.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Right.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
Turn on the computer.

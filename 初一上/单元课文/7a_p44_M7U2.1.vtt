There is a computer in my home, and my father and I share it.

00:07.000 --> 00:18.000
My father is a manager of a company, so he often talks to his customers on the computer.

00:18.000 --> 00:29.000
He also goes on the internet to check the times of trains, make travel plans, and buy tickets.

00:29.000 --> 00:38.000
I listen to music or watch movies on it every Friday night. Jack.

00:38.000 --> 00:44.000
There is no computer in my home. I can only use it at school.

00:44.000 --> 00:52.000
On the internet, I search for information, do my homework, and check my email.

00:52.000 --> 01:02.000
I have a friend in Australia. I can see her and talk to her on the internet. Alice.

01:02.000 --> 01:11.000
We have a computer at home. My parents don't use it. I can use it on Sundays.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.000
I send email to my friends and play computer games.

01:17.000 --> 01:24.000
But sometimes I play a lot of games, and my mother doesn't like it. Mike.

What's that, Betty?

00:02.000 --> 00:06.000
It's a birthday present for my friend, Doming.

00:06.640 --> 00:08.640
And what about this?

00:09.280 --> 00:12.080
It's a birthday card for him, too.

00:12.880 --> 00:16.480
Does your friend usually have a birthday party?

00:16.480 --> 00:18.000
I don't know.

00:18.400 --> 00:20.800
What about a birthday cake?

00:21.040 --> 00:24.640
I'm not sure, but I can ask him.

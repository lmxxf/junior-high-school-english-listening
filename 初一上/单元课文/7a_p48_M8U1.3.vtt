Hi, would you like to come to my birthday party?

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
Yes, I'd love to. When is it?

00:08.000 --> 00:14.000
This Saturday at my house. Okay, I always like birthday parties.

00:14.000 --> 00:21.000
Great! What do you usually do at a Chinese birthday party?

00:21.000 --> 00:28.000
At the birthday dinner, we eat noodles and we eat birthday cake too.

00:28.000 --> 00:37.000
But my mother never makes a birthday cake. She usually buys a special one and I cut it at the party.

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
And we sometimes give birthday cards.

00:41.000 --> 00:48.000
Do you usually sing Happy Birthday? Yes, we always sing Happy Birthday.

00:48.000 --> 00:56.000
Do you sing it in Chinese or in English? We sing it in Chinese and English.

00:56.000 --> 01:06.000
Do you get birthday presents in China? Sometimes, Daming always gets birthday presents.

01:06.000 --> 01:13.000
So, what would you like for your birthday, Daming? It's a secret!

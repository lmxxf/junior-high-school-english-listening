One.

00:02.000 --> 00:03.000
Hooray!

00:03.000 --> 00:06.000
We're finally walking on the Great Wall.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
Shhh! I'm calling my mother!

Two.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
What are you doing, Ling Ling?

00:21.000 --> 00:22.000
I'm shopping.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000

What are you doing, Wong Hoey?

00:33.000 --> 00:34.000
Taking a photo?

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
Yes, I'm taking your photo.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
No, not me.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
I'm lying in the sun and eating an ice cream.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
Four.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
Look! Everyone's standing in line.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Yes, they're waiting for the bus.

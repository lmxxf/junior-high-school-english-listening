Hi mom.

00:02.000 --> 00:06.000
Hello Betty. Where are you now?

00:06.000 --> 00:11.000
I'm standing on the great wall of China and talking to you.

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
Really? That's great.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
We're on a school trip.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
What about the others? Are they with you?

00:20.000 --> 00:26.000
Well, right now Tony is eating a delicious ice cream.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
Wang Huang is taking lots of photos.

00:30.000 --> 00:37.000
Ling Ling is buying a few presents and postcards. They're on sale at the shop.

00:37.000 --> 00:42.000
Dum Ming is having lunch and lying in the sun.

00:42.000 --> 00:51.000
I'd like a postcard too, but please take some photos of the great wall and send them to me by email.

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
Okay, we're enjoying the school trip a lot.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
Anyway, it's time to go back to school now. Bye mom.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Bye Betty.

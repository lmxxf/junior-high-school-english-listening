Hi Ling Ling, this is Tony speaking. What's happening? Are you getting ready for spring festival?

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
Yes we are. We're quite busy now.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.500
What are you doing at the moment?

00:17.500 --> 00:21.000
I'm making big red lanterns.

00:21.500 --> 00:30.000
Ah, I like them. They are very beautiful. Is your father helping you?

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
No he isn't. He's still at work.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.500
What's your mother doing?

00:36.500 --> 00:40.500
She's cleaning the house and putting things away.

00:40.500 --> 00:44.500
Ah, she's working so hard.

00:45.000 --> 00:53.500
Yes, my aunt is sweeping the floor and my grandma is cooking the meal in the kitchen.

00:53.500 --> 00:57.500
What a charming and betty doing.

00:57.500 --> 01:02.000
They're learning a dragon dance with my grandpa.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Can I join them?

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
Of course. Hurry up.

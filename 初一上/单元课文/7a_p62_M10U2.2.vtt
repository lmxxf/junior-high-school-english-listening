I'm Lee Shan from China.

00:03.640 --> 00:08.480
Spring Festival is very important in my country.

00:08.480 --> 00:14.760
Like Christmas, it happens every year, but not on the same day.

00:14.760 --> 00:21.160
It usually comes in February, but sometimes it comes in January.

00:21.160 --> 00:24.160
I've got some photos of it.

00:24.160 --> 00:26.160
Have a look at them.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.160
Hey!

00:27.640 --> 00:29.920
Here's the first one.

00:29.920 --> 00:33.760
It's a few days before Spring Festival.

00:33.760 --> 00:39.440
My mother's cleaning our house and sweeping away bad luck.

00:39.440 --> 00:42.560
Look at the food on the table.

00:42.560 --> 00:48.080
We always buy a lot of food before the festival.

00:48.080 --> 00:49.480
B.

00:49.480 --> 00:52.440
Oh, I love this photo.

00:52.440 --> 00:58.240
We are celebrating Spring Festival with a traditional family dinner on the evening

00:58.240 --> 01:00.360
before Spring Festival.

01:00.360 --> 01:03.640
There's so much delicious food.

01:03.640 --> 01:08.840
I am eating Jiao Zhe, a kind of dumpling.

01:08.840 --> 01:15.000
After the dinner, we usually watch a special program on TV.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.240
C.

01:17.240 --> 01:23.560
In this photo, my parents and I are visiting my uncles and aunts.

01:23.560 --> 01:26.880
We are wearing new sweaters and coats.

01:26.880 --> 01:29.560
I always get a honk ball.

01:29.560 --> 01:32.560
It means lucky money.

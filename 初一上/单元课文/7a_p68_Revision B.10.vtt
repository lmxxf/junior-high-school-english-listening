What do you like doing at a Christmas party, Betty?

00:04.000 --> 00:10.000
I like singing Christmas songs. How about you?

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
I like dancing to your songs. That's great.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
What about Doming?

00:18.000 --> 00:25.000
He doesn't like singing or dancing. There he is. Let's ask him.

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
Hi, Doming. What do you like doing at a Christmas party?

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
I like playing games. And I like getting the food ready.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
Can you help me?

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
Okay. What can we do?

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
Can you buy some cola and juice?

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
Sure. And have we got a Christmas tree?

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
Yes, we have.

00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Where are you going on holiday, Tony?

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
To Los Angeles.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
Oh, really? You'll love it.

00:09.000 --> 00:14.000
I went there two years ago and enjoyed it a lot.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
How long did it take to get there? Did you fly?

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
Yes, we did. And that took about nine hours.

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000
Then our friends met us and drove us to their home.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
Who is with you?

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
My parents.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
So, what did you do?

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
Well, first we went to Disneyland and guess what?

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
I met Snow White and Mickey Mouse.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
I was so excited.

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
Wow! How long did you stay there?

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
We stayed there for two days and then we went to Hollywood.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
Did you see any movie stars?

01:01.000 --> 01:06.000
No, but we swam in the Pacific Ocean at Santa Monica.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
Oh, it was great.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
Where are you going on holiday this year, Betty?

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Paris.

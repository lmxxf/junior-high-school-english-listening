Hi, Grandma! Here I am in Paris. Jenny and I arrived by plane the day before yesterday.

00:11.000 --> 00:18.800
Aunt Joan and Uncle Pete met us at the airport. We were tired, so we relaxed at home and

00:18.800 --> 00:27.040
began our tour of the city yesterday. Yesterday we went to the Louvre Museum. It has many

00:27.040 --> 00:36.600
world famous works of art, such as the Mona Lisa. In the evening we had dinner in a French restaurant.

00:36.600 --> 00:46.800
The food was delicious. This morning we took a walk. There are shops and restaurants everywhere,

00:46.800 --> 00:56.280
and I loved the street markets. They sell such good fruit and vegetables. We also did some shopping.

00:56.280 --> 01:05.880
I bought a present for you. I hope you'll like it. At about three o'clock we took the Paris

01:05.880 --> 01:16.120
underground to the Eiffel Tower. It is really high. There were lots of tourists, so first of all we

01:16.120 --> 01:23.960
had to wait in line for an hour, and then we went to the top. We waited till all the lights were on.

01:24.680 --> 01:33.560
It was wonderful. Tomorrow we're going to visit a famous palace and take a boat tour on the river

01:33.560 --> 01:37.560
saying, I'll ride again. Love Betty.

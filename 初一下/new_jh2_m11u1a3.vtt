We're going to have some Russian teachers at school tomorrow, and I'm welcoming the visitors.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
How do I do that?

00:10.000 --> 00:17.000
Lingling, you know, in Russia, people usually kiss three times.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
Left? Right? Left.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
What? No, I didn't know that.

00:24.000 --> 00:31.000
But we Chinese often shake hands and smile when we meet visitors.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
And sometimes we nod our heads.

00:34.000 --> 00:41.000
But we never kiss. Only parents and children do that.

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
That's because people do different things in different countries.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.000
So what do people in the US usually do when they meet?

00:52.000 --> 00:59.000
In the US, some people shake hands and some kiss or hug each other.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.000
In India, people put their hands together and nod their heads.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
And do you know what marry people in New Zealand do when they meet?

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
No, what do they do?

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
They touch noses.

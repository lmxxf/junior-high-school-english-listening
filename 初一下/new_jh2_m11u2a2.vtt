00:00.000 --> 00:07.400
Body language around the world by Wang Lingling

00:07.400 --> 00:15.920
Our new foreign students are going to arrive very soon and here are some ways to welcome them.

00:15.920 --> 00:20.840
How close do you stand when you talk to a friend?

00:20.840 --> 00:28.720
You can stand close to people in the Middle East but don't stand too close to North Americans.

00:28.720 --> 00:32.640
Give them more personal space.

00:32.640 --> 00:36.000
How about touching people?

00:36.000 --> 00:41.360
Chinese girls often walk arm in arm with their friends.

00:41.360 --> 00:49.120
South Americans sometimes hold your arm when they talk to you so you can't move away.

00:49.120 --> 00:56.000
But in Britain many people don't like other people to touch them at all.

00:56.080 --> 00:59.760
Do you look at people when you talk?

00:59.760 --> 01:05.840
In some places it isn't polite to look at people when you talk.

01:05.840 --> 01:10.960
But in other countries it isn't polite to look somewhere else.

01:10.960 --> 01:17.680
In Britain and the US people usually look at each other when they talk.

01:17.680 --> 01:20.480
And how do you say goodbye?

01:20.480 --> 01:22.320
That's easy.

01:22.320 --> 01:25.280
Wave to say goodbye.

01:25.360 --> 01:27.120
But be careful.

01:27.120 --> 01:30.880
In Greece it's not at all polite.

01:30.880 --> 01:34.880
In fact it's very rude.

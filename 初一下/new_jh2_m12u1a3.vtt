00:00.000 --> 00:10.080
Hmm, this is Western music, isn't it?

00:10.080 --> 00:14.080
Can you hear the violin and the piano?

00:14.080 --> 00:17.360
It's so beautiful.

00:17.360 --> 00:20.920
Is this by Strauss or Mozart?

00:20.920 --> 00:23.560
I'm not sure.

00:23.560 --> 00:24.960
It's by Strauss.

00:24.960 --> 00:27.560
I love his music.

00:27.560 --> 00:37.200
Do you know anything about him, Tony?

00:37.200 --> 00:39.120
Was he German?

00:39.120 --> 00:40.120
No.

00:40.120 --> 00:45.160
He was born in Vienna, the capital of Austria.

00:45.160 --> 00:48.160
What a beautiful city.

00:48.160 --> 00:50.880
This is called the Blue Danube.

00:50.880 --> 00:54.200
The Danube is a river in Europe.

00:54.200 --> 00:57.520
It goes through Vienna.

00:57.520 --> 01:02.840
Do you like traditional Western music or pop music, Betty?

01:02.840 --> 01:06.360
Well, I like both.

01:06.360 --> 01:09.840
You listen to pop music, Wang Wang, don't you?

01:09.840 --> 01:12.360
Yes, I do.

01:12.360 --> 01:15.240
I also like Beijing Opera.

01:15.240 --> 01:18.880
Listen to this fantastic voice.

01:18.880 --> 01:25.880
Hi, Jim Wang.

01:25.880 --> 01:36.400
Hmm, the sound is very different, isn't it?

01:36.400 --> 01:39.480
I'm a fan of rock music.

01:39.480 --> 01:41.480
Listen to this.

01:42.480 --> 01:46.480
Oh, hey, give us a break.

01:46.480 --> 01:47.480
Rock music?

01:47.480 --> 01:50.680
Oh, listen to those drums.

01:50.680 --> 01:53.480
It's so noisy.

01:53.480 --> 01:56.040
I'm much too fast.

01:56.040 --> 01:59.200
You don't like rock music.

01:59.200 --> 02:00.440
I don't believe it.

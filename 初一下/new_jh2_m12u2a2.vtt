The City of Music

00:04.000 --> 00:11.000
Vienna is a beautiful old city on the River Danube in the centre of Europe.

00:12.000 --> 00:19.000
It's the capital city of Austria and the centre of European classical music.

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
In the 18th century, a lot of musicians came to study and work in Vienna.

00:28.000 --> 00:38.000
In the Strauss family, there were two composers called Johann Strauss, the father and the son.

00:39.000 --> 00:49.000
The father, Johann Strauss the Elder, wrote and played music for traditional dances called the Waltz.

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
His dance music made him famous all over Europe.

00:56.000 --> 01:03.000
The son, Johann Strauss the Younger, was also very successful and popular.

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
He wrote over 150 Waltz's.

01:09.000 --> 01:15.000
In 1867, he wrote the Blue Danube Waltz.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
Mozart was another very important composer.

01:21.000 --> 01:26.000
He was born in Austria in 1756.

01:27.000 --> 01:34.000
Before he was six, he played not only the piano but also the violin.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.000
His family took him around Europe and he gave concerts in many cities.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
He wrote hundreds of wonderful pieces of music.

01:47.000 --> 01:55.000
But he became very poor and died in 1791 when he was only 35.

01:56.000 --> 02:03.000
Like Johann Strauss, father and son, he was a great European musician.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
And many people still think his music is perfect.

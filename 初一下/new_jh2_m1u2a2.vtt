The Lost and Found Office in New York City

00:05.120 --> 00:11.680
Welcome to the New York City Lost and Found Office.

00:11.680 --> 00:17.580
People often lose things when they're traveling or when they're in a hurry.

00:17.580 --> 00:26.280
They leave things on planes, on trains, on buses, and in taxis.

00:26.280 --> 00:33.320
That's why there are Lost and Found offices at airports and stations.

00:33.320 --> 00:39.560
The New York City Lost and Found Office is very big.

00:39.560 --> 00:43.760
Hundreds of people come here every day.

00:43.760 --> 00:53.240
They are looking for their phones, cameras, watches, computers, and many other things.

00:53.240 --> 01:01.640
We usually have about 2,000 mobile phones and 1,000 cameras.

01:01.640 --> 01:10.120
At the moment there are also some strange things at the New York City Lost and Found Office.

01:10.120 --> 01:17.280
There are about a hundred bikes and a large boat.

01:17.280 --> 01:20.920
There are also a lot of animals.

01:20.920 --> 01:27.760
This week there are three dogs, two ducks, and a pig.

01:27.760 --> 01:30.760
Who's are they?

01:30.760 --> 01:32.720
Are they yours?

01:32.720 --> 01:34.800
We don't know.

01:34.800 --> 01:39.560
Are you looking for 15 kilos of sausages?

01:39.560 --> 01:40.520
They're here too.

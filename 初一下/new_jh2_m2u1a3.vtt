Can you cook, darling?

00:23.080 --> 00:25.280

Don't worry about Chinese.

00:54.600 --> 01:00.920
We can teach you Chinese, so choose your favorite club.

01:00.920 --> 01:02.560
Okay, then.

01:02.560 --> 01:08.240
I play table tennis, so I choose the table tennis club.

01:08.240 --> 01:10.760
That's my favorite.

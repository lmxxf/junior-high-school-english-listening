00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
It's the start of the new term and we're choosing our new monitors.

00:07.000 --> 00:16.000
I'd like to be the class monitor. I get on well with everyone, classmates and teachers.

00:16.000 --> 00:25.000
I work very hard and I do well at school. I'm kind and I'm always ready to help others.

00:25.000 --> 00:35.000
I can even help teachers too. Choose me as your class monitor and I promise to help you.

00:35.000 --> 00:49.000
I want to be the PE monitor. I enjoy sport and I can run really fast. I'm really fit and healthy.

00:49.000 --> 01:05.000
Just watch me in the playground between lessons. I play most ball games well but I'm really good at football and I play basketball in the school team.

01:05.000 --> 01:17.000
I usually get the best score in every match. Choose me for the PE monitor and you can get the best score too.

01:17.000 --> 01:28.000
I'd like to be the cleaning monitor. I often help my mother do cleaning at home and I like a clean and tidy house.

01:28.000 --> 01:40.000
I'm sure everybody would like a clean classroom just like home. Choose me and we can make our classroom beautiful.

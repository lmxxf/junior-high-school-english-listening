What are you going to do at the weekend, Doming?

00:04.000 --> 00:11.000
On Saturday morning, I'm going to check my email and do my homework.

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
Then I'm going to help with the housework.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
What are you going to do, Betty?

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
I'm going to see a movie in the afternoon. You can come too.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
Sure. Who else is going to be there?

00:27.000 --> 00:35.000
Nobody. Ling Ling is going to have a piano lesson so she can't come with us.

00:35.000 --> 00:41.000
But on Sunday afternoon, Ling Ling and I are going to have a picnic.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
Would you like to join us?

00:43.000 --> 00:48.000
Yes, I'd love to. Are we going to meet here?

00:48.000 --> 00:54.000
No, we aren't. We're going to meet in the park at 1 o'clock.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
Hi, everyone.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
Hi, Tony. What are your plans for the weekend?

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
Oh, nothing. I'm going to stay at home alone.

01:05.000 --> 01:13.000
Don't be silly. You're going to come with us. It's going to be a fantastic weekend.

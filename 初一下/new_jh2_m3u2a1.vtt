What are you going to do?

00:03.000 --> 00:04.000
Hey!

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
I'm looking forward to the football match tomorrow.

00:08.000 --> 00:13.000
My friends and I are going to watch our favourite team.

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
We're going to meet other fans and make some new friends.

00:18.000 --> 00:24.000
We're all going to wear the team shirt and we're going to cheer the players.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
I hope they win the match.

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
I'm going to enjoy myself during the May Day holiday.

00:36.000 --> 00:44.000
On the morning of the 1st of May, I'm going to get up late and then read a book.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.000
In the afternoon, I'm going out with my family and friends.

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
We're going to take a walk in the country or go swimming.

00:56.000 --> 01:03.000
And on the 2nd of May, we're going to collect litter in the park near my friend's house.

01:03.000 --> 01:10.000
It's going to be a great holiday, busy but good fun.

01:12.000 --> 01:18.000
See, usually I spend the summer holiday at home,

01:18.000 --> 01:24.000
but this year is going to be very different because I'm going on a summer camp

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
in Sydney, Australia.

01:27.000 --> 01:33.000
I'm going to stay with an Australian family and speak English.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.000
We're also going sightseeing and going to have a picnic on the beach.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000

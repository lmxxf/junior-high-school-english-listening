00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
Do you often think about the future?

00:04.560 --> 00:07.840
What will change in 20 years?

00:07.840 --> 00:10.320
Will our life be different?

00:10.320 --> 00:11.640
The weather?

00:11.640 --> 00:13.120
Our clothes?

00:13.120 --> 00:14.520
Our school?

00:14.520 --> 00:15.520
Yes.

00:15.520 --> 00:18.480
Everything will be different.

00:18.480 --> 00:24.200
We'll use computers and they'll be very small in light.

00:24.200 --> 00:28.040
And we only need one book to carry to school.

00:28.040 --> 00:29.560
Oh, good.

00:29.560 --> 00:32.000
Anybody else?

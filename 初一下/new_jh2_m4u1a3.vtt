00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Will schools be different in the future, darling?

00:04.000 --> 00:12.000
Yes, they will. In 20 years' time, maybe there won't be any schools.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
How will students learn then?

00:16.000 --> 00:25.000
Everyone will study at home. Students will use computers and get information on the internet.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.000
They can ask their teachers questions by internet, telephone or email.

00:31.000 --> 00:40.000
Well, I'm not sure. Yes, students will use computers, but school is good fun.

00:40.000 --> 00:47.000
And you can make friends there. And teachers can check the students level and will help them.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
Computers won't be able to do that.

00:51.000 --> 01:00.000
Yes, teachers won't use chalk on a blackboard, and students won't use pens and paper or erases anymore.

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
Great! Will students have a lot of homework to do?

01:05.000 --> 01:12.000
No, they won't. They'll have a lot of free time. That'll be great!

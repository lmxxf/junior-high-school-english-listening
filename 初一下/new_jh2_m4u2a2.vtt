00:00.000 --> 00:06.160
Life in the future by Tony Smith.

00:06.160 --> 00:09.440
What will life be like in the future?

00:09.440 --> 00:11.960
How will things change?

00:11.960 --> 00:14.280
Here are some ideas.

00:14.280 --> 00:16.760
Which ones will come true?

00:16.760 --> 00:17.760
A.

00:17.760 --> 00:24.960
In the future, a change of weather won't mean a change of clothes.

00:24.960 --> 00:28.440
We'll wear a new kind of clothes.

00:28.440 --> 00:34.200
There'll be warm when we're cold and cool when we're hot.

00:34.200 --> 00:37.200
B.

00:37.200 --> 00:43.120
There'll be no more light rain and cold wind in spring.

00:43.120 --> 00:51.640
The weather will be quite warm or even hot all year with heavy rain and wind.

00:51.640 --> 00:55.960
The sea level will rise as well.

00:55.960 --> 00:57.400
Sea.

00:57.400 --> 01:01.600
We won't travel by bus or by anymore.

01:01.600 --> 01:05.080
Every family will have a small plane.

01:05.080 --> 01:07.760
No more expensive cars.

01:07.760 --> 01:11.560
It'll be cheap to travel everywhere by plane.

01:11.560 --> 01:19.440
Not only overland, but also over the sea or even into space.

01:19.440 --> 01:23.800
Maybe there'll be traffic jams in the air.

01:23.800 --> 01:24.800
D.

01:25.720 --> 01:28.400
Do you like long holidays?

01:28.400 --> 01:32.040
Well, you're going to like the future.

01:32.040 --> 01:39.120
Because machines and robots will do all the heavy and difficult jobs.

01:39.120 --> 01:43.720
And we'll only do light and easy work.

01:43.720 --> 01:49.920
Working hours will be short, so people will have long holidays.

It's Mother's Day soon, and I want to buy my mum a t-shirt.

00:06.360 --> 00:11.440
OK, I want to make a cake for my mother.

00:11.440 --> 00:16.200
How about going to the shops tomorrow afternoon, Ling Ling?

00:16.200 --> 00:23.000
We can buy a t-shirt first, and then buy some food in the market on our way back.

00:23.000 --> 00:28.080
All right, what do you want to get for this cake?

00:28.080 --> 00:31.080
Strawberries and biscuits.

00:31.080 --> 00:33.080
And let me think.

00:33.080 --> 00:36.080
Ah, some lemons.

00:36.080 --> 00:39.080
OK, see you tomorrow.

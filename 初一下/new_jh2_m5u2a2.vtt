Online shopping

00:03.000 --> 00:06.000
There are many new ways of shopping

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
and online shopping is one of them.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
You can buy almost everything on the internet

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
and it's very easy.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
First, you choose something, clothes,

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
tickets, a mobile phone,

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
even a new computer,

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
and pay for it.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
Then you receive it a few days later by post.

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
Online shopping has several advantages.

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
First, you can shop at any time.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
The shops are always open.

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
Second, shopping usually takes a lot of time.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
But to shop on the internet,

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
you only need a computer and a mouse.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
You can also compare the prices of the same product

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
and spend a lot or save money.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
But many people like going out and shopping with friends.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
They don't like shopping on the internet

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
because they can't see the product or try the clothes on.

01:18.000 --> 01:24.000
Also, paying over the internet isn't always safe.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
Online shopping is changing our way of life.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
One day, no one will go to the shops anymore

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
because you'll be able to buy anything on the internet

01:36.000 --> 01:42.000
and you will be able to receive it anywhere in the world at any time.

Where were you born, Betty?

00:03.600 --> 00:09.000
I was born in Quincy, a small town in the US.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.520
What was your first school like?

00:11.520 --> 00:15.880
My first school was John Adams Primary School.

00:15.880 --> 00:20.240
It wasn't a big school and it was very friendly.

00:20.240 --> 00:23.200
There were 20 students in my class.

00:23.200 --> 00:25.160
Who was your first teacher?

00:25.160 --> 00:26.440
Ms. Smith.

00:26.440 --> 00:28.560
Was she strict?

00:28.560 --> 00:31.640
Well, yes, she was.

00:31.640 --> 00:34.480
But she was also very nice to us.

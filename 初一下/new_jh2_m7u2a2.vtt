My Life in Quincy by Betty King.

00:06.000 --> 00:14.000
I was born in Quincy, a town on the east coast of America 12 years ago.

00:14.000 --> 00:21.800
There were lots of things to do in Quincy, with many stores, two movie theaters, football

00:21.800 --> 00:26.600
clubs, and basketball teams too.

00:26.600 --> 00:29.400
I wasn't born in Quincy.

00:29.400 --> 00:33.000
I was very happy there.

00:33.000 --> 00:43.360
Two presidents of the US, John Adams and son John Quincy Adams were born in Quincy.

00:43.360 --> 00:48.520
You can visit their old family houses.

00:48.520 --> 00:52.440
Our house was big and comfortable.

00:52.440 --> 01:02.120
There was a big living room with a TV, a kitchen, a bathroom, and three bedrooms.

01:02.120 --> 01:09.240
On my bedroom walls there were pictures of my favorite movie stars.

01:09.240 --> 01:16.960
Behind the house there was a big garden with lots of trees, and there was a small lake

01:16.960 --> 01:19.360
with fish in it.

01:19.360 --> 01:23.080
It was great to play there.

01:23.080 --> 01:26.560
There were lots of children in Quincy.

01:26.560 --> 01:29.800
Many of them were my friends.

01:29.800 --> 01:38.360
This was our last home in the US, and I was there for the last time in 2010.

01:38.360 --> 01:43.080
One day I'll go back, and I'm looking forward to seeing my friends again.

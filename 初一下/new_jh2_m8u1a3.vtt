00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
All alone in the dark, dark forest, Goldilocks picked some flowers.

00:09.000 --> 00:15.000
Oh! Did she often go for a walk in the forest alone?

00:15.000 --> 00:25.000
No, she didn't. And soon she was lost. Goldilocks looked around her.

00:25.000 --> 00:38.000
Where am I? She asked. Then she noticed a little house, so she hurried towards it and knocked on the door.

00:38.000 --> 00:44.000
Nobody answered, so she knocked again and again.

00:44.000 --> 00:53.000
Finally, she pushed the door. It was open. There was nobody there.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
Oh! Didn't anyone live in the house?

00:58.000 --> 01:10.000
Oh, just wait a moment, darming. Goldilocks entered the house and looked into a small room.

01:10.000 --> 01:18.000
On a table there were three bowls with some nice food in them.

01:18.000 --> 01:27.000
One bowl was small. One was big and one was very big.

01:27.000 --> 01:40.000
Goldilocks was very hungry. She picked up the very big bowl, but she didn't like it. It was very hot.

01:40.000 --> 01:49.000
Then she picked up the big bowl, but she didn't like it. It was cold.

01:49.000 --> 01:57.000
The little bowl was just right. She finished all the food in it.

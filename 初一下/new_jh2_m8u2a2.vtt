Goldilocks and the three bears. Goldilocks wanted to sit down because she was tired.

00:10.000 --> 00:19.000
First, she tried the big chair, but it wasn't very comfortable. Then she tried the middle chair.

00:19.000 --> 00:26.000
It was not comfortable either. Finally, she tried the small chair.

00:26.000 --> 00:36.000
It was nice and comfortable, but Goldilocks was very heavy, and soon the chair was in pieces.

00:36.000 --> 00:47.000
She walked into the bedroom. There were three beds. She didn't like the middle bed or the big bed.

00:47.000 --> 00:56.000
The small bed was very comfortable. Very soon she was asleep in it.

00:56.000 --> 01:06.000
The three bears returned. They looked at the bowls and the chairs. Baby bear cried.

01:06.000 --> 01:13.000
There's nothing in my bowl, and my chair is in pieces.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
He wasn't very happy.

01:16.000 --> 01:25.000
Next, the bears looked in their bedroom. They didn't notice Goldilocks at first.

01:25.000 --> 01:31.000
Then Baby bear pointed at the little girl in his bed and shouted,

01:31.000 --> 01:42.000
Look, there's the bad girl. Goldilocks opened her eyes. The three bears were all around her.

01:42.000 --> 01:49.000
Goldilocks jumped out of bed and hurried out of the house without her basket.

01:49.000 --> 01:54.000
She didn't go for a walk in the forest again.

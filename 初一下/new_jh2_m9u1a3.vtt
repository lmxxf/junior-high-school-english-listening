What are you reading?

00:03.000 --> 00:09.000
Tom Sawyer by the famous American writer Mark Twain.

00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
I'm writing about him for my English class.

00:13.000 --> 00:17.000
I read Tom Sawyer. Very good.

00:17.000 --> 00:23.000
Hey, we can find out about him on the internet.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
Yes.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
Okay.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
Look at this.

00:29.000 --> 00:39.000
His real name was Samuel Clemens, and he was born in 1835 in Missouri.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
He left school and began work at the age of 12.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
What did he do?

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
He wrote for a newspaper.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
Later he got work on a boat.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
Did he stay in Missouri?

00:55.000 --> 01:01.000
No. He went to New York and other cities.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
When did he begin his stories?

01:04.000 --> 01:15.000
I don't know the exact date, but he took the name Mark Twain and became very famous in the 1860s.

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
He went to Europe as well, but he didn't come to China.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
Yes, I knew that.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
Enjoy the book.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
Yes, it's good.

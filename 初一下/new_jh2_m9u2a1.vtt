00:05.240 --> 00:12.400
William Shakespeare was a famous English writer of plays and poems.

00:12.400 --> 00:24.000
He wrote about 38 plays, 154 short poems and a few long poems in his life.

00:24.000 --> 00:31.400
Two of his famous plays are Hamlet and Romeo and Juliet.

00:31.400 --> 00:38.480
Shakespeare was born in 1564 in Stratford, England.

00:38.480 --> 00:47.920
Like many people 400 years ago, Shakespeare's parents didn't learn to read or write.

00:47.920 --> 00:58.400
At school he liked plays, so he decided to be an actor when he finished school at 14.

00:58.400 --> 01:05.320
He married in 1582 and had three children.

01:05.320 --> 01:13.800
Shakespeare went to London and joined a theatre company in about 1592.

01:13.800 --> 01:20.200
He became a successful actor and began to write plays.

01:20.200 --> 01:26.280
Queen Elizabeth I enjoyed his works very much.

01:26.280 --> 01:34.520
In 1599 the company built the Globe Theatre on the River Thames in London.

01:34.520 --> 01:41.040
You can visit the theatre today, but it isn't the same building.

01:41.040 --> 01:44.680
There was a fire in the old theatre.

01:44.680 --> 01:53.920
They built it again in 1614 and in the 1990s.

01:53.920 --> 01:58.440
William Shakespeare died at the age of 52.

01:58.440 --> 02:02.120
He was rich and successful.

02:02.120 --> 02:07.880
You can still see his plays in English and in many other languages.

02:07.880 --> 02:10.360

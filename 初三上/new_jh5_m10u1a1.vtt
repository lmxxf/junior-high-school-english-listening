OK, homework. Has everyone decided which country you'd like to visit? Tony?

00:09.000 --> 00:14.000
Yes, the country that I've chosen is Australia.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Good, and what is Australia famous for?

00:19.000 --> 00:28.000
Well, the Olympic Games in 2000 were held in Sydney, but that's all.

00:29.000 --> 00:40.000
Well, in the centre of the country is a huge rock called Ares Rock, and something else to see is the great barrier reef.

00:40.000 --> 00:49.000
Did you know Australia is the largest English-speaking country in the southern part of the world?

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
No.

00:50.000 --> 00:57.000
OK. For homework, you must all choose a country that you'd like to visit.

00:57.000 --> 01:05.000
I'd like you to imagine you're there and you're writing a letter to your parents back home.

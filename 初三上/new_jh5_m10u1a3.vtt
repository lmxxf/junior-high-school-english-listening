00:00.000 --> 00:03.420
Dad, I need your help.

00:03.420 --> 00:07.980
My teacher asked us to choose a country we want to visit.

00:07.980 --> 00:13.420
Imagine we were there and write a letter to our parents back home.

00:13.420 --> 00:16.820
I've chosen Australia.

00:16.820 --> 00:18.580
How can I do it?

00:18.580 --> 00:19.820
Don't worry.

00:19.820 --> 00:24.540
I have some photos that I took in Australia last year.

00:24.540 --> 00:26.500
They may help you.

00:26.500 --> 00:28.540
Here we go.

00:28.540 --> 00:34.440
This is a rock called Air's Rock in Central Australia.

00:34.440 --> 00:39.920
According to the local people, it's a special and magical place.

00:39.920 --> 00:43.200
Oh, it looks huge.

00:43.200 --> 00:44.920
What's its height?

00:44.920 --> 00:48.400
348 metres.

00:48.400 --> 00:52.400
And this is the Sydney Opera House.

00:52.400 --> 00:58.080
It's like a huge sailing boat with water on three sides.

00:58.080 --> 01:02.520
And this one is the Great Barrier Reef.

01:02.520 --> 01:06.640
Does it lie off the northeast coast of Australia?

01:06.640 --> 01:07.640
Yes.

01:07.640 --> 01:11.760
It's over 2,600 kilometres long.

01:11.760 --> 01:15.000
It's a great natural wonder.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.260
And here are some photos of my Australian friends.

01:19.260 --> 01:24.560
Their sheep farmers, they wear special hats that keep the flies away.

01:24.560 --> 01:29.720
The scissors that they're holding are used to cut the wool off the sheep.

01:29.720 --> 01:33.520
Do you know that many Australians came from Britain?

01:33.520 --> 01:35.640
Yes, of course.

01:35.640 --> 01:38.560
That's why they speak English.

01:38.560 --> 01:41.280
Did you keep a diary while you were there?

01:41.280 --> 01:42.280
Yes.

01:42.280 --> 01:43.600
And you can read it.

01:43.600 --> 01:45.680
That's great.

01:45.680 --> 01:49.240
And what didn't you like about Australia?

01:49.240 --> 01:53.560
I hated the ants that were all over the place.

01:53.560 --> 01:58.160
I had to brush them off my clothes, especially my trousers.

01:58.160 --> 01:59.160
Ha ha!

01:59.160 --> 02:01.440
Ands on your trousers.

02:01.440 --> 02:03.120
That's really funny.

02:03.120 --> 02:04.720
It wasn't funny at the time.

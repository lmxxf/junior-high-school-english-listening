00:00.000 --> 00:07.280
Dear Mum and Dad, I am writing this letter to you from the centre of Australia.

00:07.280 --> 00:11.560
At the moment we are staying near Ares Rock.

00:11.560 --> 00:18.840
On the first day we took a plane tour over the rock and I was surprised at how big it was,

00:18.840 --> 00:27.080
3.6 km long and 348 m high.

00:27.080 --> 00:36.560
In different periods of the day, the colours of the rock turn dark blue, purple, yellow and red.

00:36.560 --> 00:41.800
Ares Rock is a centre of local Aboriginal culture.

00:41.800 --> 00:47.640
The Aborigines are the people that have lived in Australia from the earliest times and

00:47.640 --> 00:53.680
their ancient stories describe the spirits that created the world.

00:53.680 --> 00:58.240
The Australians have a close relationship with the British.

00:58.240 --> 01:03.720
Many have British relatives and they are like us in many ways.

01:03.720 --> 01:11.240
The foods that Australians like most are ham and beef with lots of salad.

01:11.240 --> 01:15.920
They also grow grapes and other fruits.

01:15.920 --> 01:23.640
They love all sports but the game that they like most is Australian football.

01:23.640 --> 01:26.840
Those most Australians live near the coast.

01:26.840 --> 01:35.520
They also love going to the beach for swimming and surfing or just lying in the sun.

01:35.520 --> 01:40.160
Although it is December, it is summer over here.

01:40.160 --> 01:47.120
The sun is very bright and near the coast the countryside is very green.

01:47.120 --> 01:52.480
There are lots of sheep in the fields and on the hills but the middle of the country

01:52.480 --> 02:00.960
has no trees or grass, just rocks and sand and kangaroos.

02:00.960 --> 02:05.480
Australians speak English but in their own way.

02:05.480 --> 02:14.000
For example, when they say, good day and no worries, they mean hello and don't worry about

02:14.000 --> 02:17.160
it is not a problem.

02:17.160 --> 02:20.360
On the second day we went horse riding.

02:20.360 --> 02:26.480
The horse that I rode was lazy so I was left far behind the others.

02:26.480 --> 02:31.360
But I enjoyed the slow and relaxing ride.

02:31.360 --> 02:36.960
Later this evening we are taking the plane back to Sydney and coming home.

02:36.960 --> 02:39.480
It has been a wonderful trip.

02:39.480 --> 02:40.720
Love, Tony.

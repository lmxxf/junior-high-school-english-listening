00:00.000 --> 00:02.400
Do you want to see my photos?

00:02.400 --> 00:04.000
What photos?

00:04.000 --> 00:06.600
The photos that I took in Australia.

00:06.600 --> 00:09.600
Oh, yes. I'd love to see them.

00:09.600 --> 00:13.600
Well, here I am in a zoo near Brisbane.

00:13.600 --> 00:16.800
What's the strange animal that you're holding?

00:16.800 --> 00:21.200
It's a special Australian bear called a koala bear.

00:21.200 --> 00:24.600
It's a lovely little animal that lives in trees.

00:24.600 --> 00:26.400
It's so cute.

00:26.600 --> 00:27.600
Yes.

00:27.600 --> 00:30.600
And this photo was taken in the outback,

00:30.600 --> 00:33.600
a wild area that most people want to visit

00:33.600 --> 00:35.800
after the main tourist sites,

00:35.800 --> 00:39.000
because it's so different from anywhere else.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.400
It's just sand and rocks, isn't it?

00:42.400 --> 00:47.800
Yes. It's the driest and loneliest place that I've ever been to.

00:47.800 --> 00:52.200
Look, there's nothing around as far as you can see.

00:52.200 --> 00:57.000
And this is the hotel that I stayed in at the Great Barrier Reef.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.600
It looks wonderful. Right on the beach.

01:00.600 --> 01:03.400
Yes. It was amazing.

01:03.400 --> 01:06.400
Did you take this photo underwater?

01:06.400 --> 01:10.800
Yes. With a special camera that I borrowed from my uncle.

01:10.800 --> 01:14.800
It must have been a wonderful site, all those fish.

01:14.800 --> 01:19.000
It was probably the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.800
It's an experience I'll never forget.

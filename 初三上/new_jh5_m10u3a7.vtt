00:00.000 --> 00:05.200
My family came to live in Australia from Britain 10 years ago.

00:05.200 --> 00:11.000
I was only four then, so I do not remember what it was like in Britain.

00:11.000 --> 00:14.400
But my mum says that it rained a lot.

00:14.400 --> 00:17.400
First, we lived in Sydney.

00:17.400 --> 00:20.000
Our garden was beautiful.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.600
There were lots of trees with yellow flowers.

00:23.600 --> 00:27.400
I remember the picnics that we had there.

00:27.600 --> 00:31.200
My mum made salads with cold beef.

00:31.200 --> 00:36.000
And we also ate sweet Australian grapes.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.200
The big problem with the picnics was the ants.

00:40.200 --> 00:44.000
As soon as we started to eat, they arrived.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
We all tried to brush them off, but it was no good.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.200
They got everywhere.

00:51.200 --> 00:56.000
Ants were a problem at the next place that we lived in too.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.400
This time it was in Central Australia.

00:59.400 --> 01:04.600
It was very hot there, and there were a lot of flies.

01:04.600 --> 01:12.200
Also, my mum was always worried about the sun and made us stay inside a lot.

01:12.200 --> 01:15.200
We did not stay there very long.

01:15.200 --> 01:21.200
I was 10 when we moved back to Sydney, and we are still here.

01:21.200 --> 01:24.000
I like the place that we live in now.

01:24.000 --> 01:29.200
Although I do not like ants, I think they are better than flies.

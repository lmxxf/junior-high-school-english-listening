Daming, I want to enter the photo competition this year.

00:06.280 --> 00:11.440
Really? Excellent. Let me have a look at your photo.

00:11.440 --> 00:16.280
Here it is. I took it at a concert last week.

00:16.280 --> 00:23.160
I think I've seen those people before, but I can't quite remember where.

00:23.160 --> 00:24.840
Who are they?

00:24.840 --> 00:29.800
They're the Blues boys. They're the ones who played at the school dance.

00:29.800 --> 00:33.720
Oh, that's right. I remember now.

00:33.720 --> 00:37.240
The boy on the right is the guitar player.

00:37.240 --> 00:43.560
The boy in the centre is the singer, and the boy at the back is the drummer.

00:43.560 --> 00:51.000
It's a nice photo, Lingling, but I don't think that it's good enough to win the competition.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.800
I saw the photos in last year's competition.

00:54.800 --> 00:57.400
Some were really good.

00:57.400 --> 01:03.080
Well, we'll see. I'm still going to enter the competition.

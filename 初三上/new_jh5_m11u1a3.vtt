00:00.000 --> 00:05.100
Are you going to enter the photo competition, Tony?

00:05.100 --> 00:06.600
You bet.

00:06.600 --> 00:09.760
I want to beat Huo Jun this year.

00:09.760 --> 00:12.320
He's not going to win it twice.

00:12.320 --> 00:14.960
Huo Jun?

00:14.960 --> 00:20.560
He's the boy who won the photo competition last year.

00:20.560 --> 00:23.480
The one who took photos at the school dance.

00:23.480 --> 00:24.960
That's right.

00:24.960 --> 00:27.920
The thing is, he's really good.

00:27.920 --> 00:33.040
And the general standard of the competition is much higher this year.

00:33.040 --> 00:39.200
I have a feeling that we can solve these little difficulties.

00:39.200 --> 00:43.360
What are the subjects that they've chosen for this year's competition?

00:43.360 --> 00:50.680
Nature, home and away, city and people, and music.

00:50.680 --> 00:54.520
I think Huo Jun will choose music.

00:54.520 --> 01:01.040
Why don't you choose the subject home and away and take photos of Beijing?

01:01.040 --> 01:04.160
But Beijing isn't my hometown.

01:04.160 --> 01:05.400
It's Cambridge.

01:05.400 --> 01:07.760
It doesn't matter.

01:07.760 --> 01:15.080
Take some photos of Beijing and add some photos of Cambridge that you took recently.

01:15.080 --> 01:17.280
That's a good idea.

01:17.280 --> 01:24.480
What about that photo of my cousin flying kites with Chinese kids in the summer palace?

01:24.520 --> 01:30.160
And the one of him reading a Chinese menu for the first time in Cambridge.

01:30.160 --> 01:32.040
Nice photos.

01:32.040 --> 01:35.040
I'm sure you're in with a chance.

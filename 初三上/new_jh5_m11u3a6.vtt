00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
The early development of photography.

00:05.000 --> 00:16.000
In 1827, a Frenchman named Niepse needed pictures for his business, but he was not good at art.

00:16.000 --> 00:24.000
So he invented a camera which was very simple and put it in a window in his house.

00:24.000 --> 00:32.000
He took a picture of his garden and this became the first successful photograph.

00:32.000 --> 00:39.000
The next important development in the history of photography was in the early 1830s.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
At that time, a new kind of camera was invented.

00:43.000 --> 00:48.000
The man who invented it was DaGaire, also French.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
He took a picture of his reading room.

00:52.000 --> 01:00.000
In his picture, you could see everything very clearly, even the smallest things.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
Soon, other people began to use DaGaire's method.

01:04.000 --> 01:10.000
Travelers brought back wonderful photos from all around the world.

01:10.000 --> 01:19.000
People took pictures of famous buildings, cities and mountains, which they could show their families and friends.

01:19.000 --> 01:24.000
After 1840, photography developed further.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.000
People could take pictures of moving things, although it was not simple.

01:30.000 --> 01:40.000
They had to carry a lot of film and other kinds of tools, but this did not stop them, especially in the US.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.000
In the 1880s, new inventions began to change photography.

01:46.000 --> 01:55.000
Anyone who wanted to take photos could buy film in small boxes, so they did not have to make the film themselves.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.000
Photography became a kind of art by the end of the 19th century.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
Some photos were not just copies of the real world.

02:05.000 --> 02:12.000
They showed ideas and feelings just as other kinds of art do.

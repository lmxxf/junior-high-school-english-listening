I'm going to tell you about the history of photography.

00:06.440 --> 00:12.760
The first successful photograph was produced in 1827.

00:12.760 --> 00:21.440
At first it took a long time to take a picture, so people in early photographs didn't smile.

00:21.440 --> 00:28.480
The first photographers needed to know not only how to take photos, but also how to develop

00:28.480 --> 00:30.280
them.

00:30.280 --> 00:38.400
Then in 1888, Kodak introduced a camera that could be used by everyone.

00:38.400 --> 00:40.680
It wasn't expensive.

00:40.680 --> 00:48.080
It was easy to use, and Kodak helped customers develop the photos.

00:48.080 --> 00:55.080
Although today we would find it big and heavy, Kodak's camera was smaller and lighter than

00:55.080 --> 00:58.440
any other earlier cameras.

00:58.440 --> 01:04.720
After its invention, taking photographs became a very popular hobby.

01:04.720 --> 01:09.400
Cameras became smaller and smaller.

01:09.400 --> 01:15.480
Cameras with computer technology were introduced in the 1990s.

01:15.480 --> 01:18.960
There isn't even a need for printing the photos.

01:18.960 --> 01:25.800
Today you can buy camera phones, so maybe there isn't even a need for a separate camera

01:25.800 --> 01:26.480
at all.

01:28.440 --> 01:35.440
The first photographer was a photographer.

01:35.440 --> 01:40.440
The photographer was a photographer.

01:40.440 --> 01:43.440
The photographer was a photographer.

01:43.440 --> 01:45.440
The photographer was a photographer.

01:45.440 --> 01:47.440
The photographer was a photographer.

01:47.440 --> 01:50.440
The photographer was a photographer.

01:50.440 --> 01:52.440
The photographer was a photographer.

01:52.440 --> 01:54.440
The photographer was a photographer.

01:54.440 --> 01:56.440
The photographer was a photographer.

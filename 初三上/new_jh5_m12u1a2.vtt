Can anyone tell me what you can see in the first photo?

00:06.000 --> 00:11.000
There is a factory and it's causing a lot of pollution.

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
Correct. So what can we do about it?

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
Well, there should be some rules to stop the pollution.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
What about the second photo?

00:24.000 --> 00:32.000
It's a recycling centre. Waste products such as glass and paper can be recycled there.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
Good. Why do we need to do that?

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
To save energy, I guess.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
Great.

After our lesson on the environment, I'm worried about the future.

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
Pollution is our great enemy and we have to fight it.

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
If the rivers are polluted, farmers can't use the water for their crops.

00:17.000 --> 00:24.000
And in some places, pollution from factories spread so the cities and villages.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
It makes people ill and may even kill them.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
Pollution is a danger to our health.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
And there are so many cars on the roads.

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
They use so much oil and cause pollution as well.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
But we're only students.

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
We can't do anything about factories and cars.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
It's no use talking about things we can't do.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
We've got to think of things we can do.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
Such as?

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
Do you think we can make our school a green school?

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
What's a green school?

01:02.000 --> 01:10.000
At a green school, every class collects waste, which can be recycled or used again.

01:10.000 --> 01:17.000
Then the school sells the waste and uses the money to help students in poor areas.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Nice idea!

01:20.000 --> 01:27.000
Students at a green school also learn ways to save energy and recycle at home.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
That means less waste.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
That's a good idea.

01:31.000 --> 01:36.000
Though pollution is heavy now, I don't think it's hopeless.

01:36.000 --> 01:42.000
If everyone starts to do something, the world will be saved.

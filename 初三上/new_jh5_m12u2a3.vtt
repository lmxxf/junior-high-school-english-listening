How to be green

00:03.000 --> 00:06.000
By one-lingling

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
How green are you?

00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
Answer these questions and find out

00:13.000 --> 00:17.000
Do you walk or ride a bike to school?

00:17.000 --> 00:22.000
Do you buy new clothes just because they are modern?

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
Do you turn off the lights when you leave the room?

00:27.000 --> 00:33.000
Do you take your own bag when shopping and not ask for a plastic bag?

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
Do you buy drinks in bottles?

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
And what do you do with the bottles when they are empty?

00:41.000 --> 00:47.000
Do you divide the waste into things to recycle and things to throw away?

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
We all need a healthy environment

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
But we produce waste every day

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
And it is harmful to our environment

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
Repeat these three words daily

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
Reduce, reuse and recycle

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
Reduce

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
Reduce means use less

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Do not waste things

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
It saves money and causes less pollution

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
Do not order more food than you can finish

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
Turn off the lights when you do not need them

01:23.000 --> 01:29.000
Before you buy something new, think whether it is really necessary

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
Because maybe the old one is just as good

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
Reuse

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
Reuse means use again

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
Use things for as long as possible

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
Look after them so that they will last

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
Repair them if possible

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
Do not throw them away and buy new ones

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
Do not use paper cups or paper bags

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
It is better to use china cups and cloth bags

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
Because they can be used many times

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
Recycle

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
Recycle means change things into something else to be reused

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
Although it takes energy to change things into something else

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
It is better than throwing things away or burning them

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
We throw tons of rubbish away each year

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
And we have to make a change

02:28.000 --> 02:34.000
Divide your rubbish into plastic, glass, paper and rubber

02:34.000 --> 02:39.000
Develop a recycling policy for the whole community

02:39.000 --> 02:45.000
Buy products such as recycled paper to help save trees

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
We cannot hope for rapid change

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
But let's take these simple steps today

02:51.000 --> 02:56.000
So that we will save the world for our grandsons and granddaughters tomorrow

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Reuse and recycle. It's a waste to throw used things away.

00:07.000 --> 00:15.000
Don't throw away things made of glass, plastic and paper, but recycle them if possible.

00:15.000 --> 00:22.000
Plastic bags are hard to recycle, so reuse the old ones when you can.

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
Take a bag with you when you go shopping.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
Reduce pollution.

00:28.000 --> 00:38.000
Producing electricity and using oil may cause pollution of the air, water and earth in many different ways.

00:38.000 --> 00:44.000
If we use less electricity and oil, we can reduce pollution.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.000
Here is some advice. Don't leave lights on and waste electricity.

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
Walk or cycle and don't drive a car unless you have to.

00:55.000 --> 01:00.000
Walking and cycling are good for your health too.

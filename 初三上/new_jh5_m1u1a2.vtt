In wonders of the world today we are talking about four wonders, two natural wonders and two man-made wonders.

00:11.000 --> 00:18.000
The two natural wonders are the Giant's Causeway and Victoria Falls.

00:18.000 --> 00:26.000
The two man-made wonders are the Terracotta Army and the Three Gorges Dam.

00:27.000 --> 00:33.000
The Terracotta Army was built in the Sin Dynasty, so it's ancient.

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
It's said to be Sin Ji Huang's personal army.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
The Three Gorges Dam is a modern wonder.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
So far it's the largest dam in the world.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000

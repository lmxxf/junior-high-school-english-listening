Let's call wonders of the world and join in the discussion. I think natural wonders are more interesting than man-made ones.

00:09.000 --> 00:15.000
And I think the Giants Causeway is the most fantastic natural wonder.

00:15.000 --> 00:23.000
Hmm, I've never seen it, so I'm not sure I agree with you. Why do you like it, Tony?

00:23.000 --> 00:35.000
Well, I visited the Giants Causeway two years ago. It's huge. There are about 40,000 rocks, most of them with six sites.

00:35.000 --> 00:41.000
It runs for several hundred meters on the eastern coast of Northern Ireland.

00:41.000 --> 00:49.000
That sounds great, though I think Victoria Falls in Africa is even more fantastic.

00:49.000 --> 00:59.000
It's about 1,700 meters wide and a hundred meters high. You can hear the loud noise a few kilometres away.

00:59.000 --> 01:07.000
Wow, that's huge. But in my opinion, man-made wonders are more exciting than natural ones.

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
Look at the terracotta army. It's more than 2,000 years old.

01:12.000 --> 01:22.000
I agree with you, Betty, and I think the three gorgeous dam is fantastic too. It's about 2,300 meters long,

01:22.000 --> 01:33.000
185 meters high and 15 meters wide at the top. It produces electricity for millions of people in China.

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
Now, who'd like to call first?

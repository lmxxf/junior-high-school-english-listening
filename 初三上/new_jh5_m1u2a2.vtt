00:00.000 --> 00:06.720
A great wonder of the natural world.

00:06.720 --> 00:12.560
When I arrived it was early morning and it was raining.

00:12.560 --> 00:18.880
I looked to the east, the sky was becoming grey.

00:18.880 --> 00:27.040
I got out of the car, went through a gate and walked along a dark path.

00:27.040 --> 00:33.320
There was nothing to see, but I knew it was there.

00:33.320 --> 00:38.640
After about a mile, a stranger appeared beside the path.

00:38.640 --> 00:42.000
Am I going the right way?

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
I asked.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.520
He knew where I was going.

00:46.520 --> 00:47.520
Yes.

00:47.520 --> 00:48.920
He replied.

00:48.920 --> 00:53.080
You'll get there in five minutes.

00:53.480 --> 00:58.200
Finally I came to some rocks and stopped.

00:58.200 --> 01:05.240
I looked over them, but it was silent and there was no sign of it.

01:05.240 --> 01:10.880
Suddenly the rain stopped and the clouds cleared.

01:10.880 --> 01:16.680
The sun rose behind me and shone on the rocks.

01:16.680 --> 01:23.280
Far below me the ground fell away and down to a river.

01:23.280 --> 01:32.160
I was looking across one of the wonders of the natural world, the Grand Canyon.

01:32.160 --> 01:40.760
I looked down to the Colorado River, a silver stream nearly one mile below me.

01:40.760 --> 01:47.440
If you put the two tallest buildings in the world on top of each other at the bottom

01:47.440 --> 01:53.560
of the canyon, they still would not reach the top.

01:53.560 --> 01:58.560
Then I looked across to the other side of the canyon.

01:58.560 --> 02:03.080
It was about fifteen miles away, maybe more.

02:03.080 --> 02:08.600
Finally I looked to my left and to my right.

02:08.600 --> 02:16.520
And on both sides the canyon went far away for more than two hundred miles.

02:16.520 --> 02:23.080
The Grand Canyon was not just big, it was huge.

02:23.080 --> 02:27.680
I remained by the canyon for about half an hour.

02:27.680 --> 02:35.920
And I asked myself, is the Grand Canyon the greatest wonder of the natural world?

02:35.920 --> 02:38.880
I certainly know the answer.

02:38.880 --> 02:39.880
What do you think?

One of the natural wonders of the world is Mount Tumalumma between China and Nepal.

00:07.420 --> 00:16.620
It is the highest mountain in the world at 8,844.43 meters.

00:16.620 --> 00:22.220
The first people to climb to the top were Sir Edmund Hillary of New Zealand and Tenzing

00:27.340 --> 00:32.460
The Empire State Building in New York in the US is one of the tallest buildings in the

00:32.460 --> 00:36.740
world and it's also one of the modern wonders.

00:36.740 --> 00:45.500

Much smaller, although thousands of years older, is the great pyramid at Giza in Egypt.

00:52.460 --> 01:00.340
It was about 146 meters tall when it was first built, but over the years it has lost about

01:00.340 --> 01:07.380
9 meters, so it is now about 137 meters tall.

01:07.380 --> 01:13.820
It's about 4,500 years old and is one of the ancient wonders of the world.

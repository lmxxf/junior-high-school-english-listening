The first of October is China's national day, isn't it, Ling Ling?

00:05.560 --> 00:13.000
Yes. The People's Republic of China was founded on the first of October, 1949.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.400
People have celebrated the national day since then.

00:16.400 --> 00:22.600
There are flowers and national flags everywhere, and we have a three-day holiday.

00:22.600 --> 00:25.880
Do you have any plans for the holiday this year?

00:26.080 --> 00:32.480
Yes. My parents and I are going to visit some friends in Shangdong Province,

00:32.480 --> 00:36.280
and we'll stay there until the end of the holiday.

00:36.280 --> 00:41.680
While we're staying with our friends, we're going to spend one day in Qing Gao.

00:41.680 --> 00:44.280
When is your national day, Betty?

00:44.280 --> 00:50.080
Our national day is called Independence Day. It's on the 4th of July.

00:50.080 --> 00:54.280
We've celebrated it since 1777.

00:54.280 --> 00:59.080
It's a public holiday, but we only have one day off.

00:59.080 --> 01:03.280
On that day, there are all kinds of holiday activities.

01:03.280 --> 01:11.480
It's the start of the vacation season, and most people take a vacation sometime in July or August.

01:11.480 --> 01:14.480
And is there anything special on that day?

01:14.480 --> 01:19.080
Well, you can see American flags everywhere.

01:19.080 --> 01:24.680
We usually have a picnic somewhere nice. Kids have great fun.

01:24.680 --> 01:29.280
We also watch bands play music in public parks.

01:29.280 --> 01:32.680
Do you have a national day in the UK, Tony?

01:32.680 --> 01:38.480
No, we don't. We celebrate Christmas with a two-day holiday,

01:38.480 --> 01:44.480
and my family always goes somewhere interesting as soon as the holiday begins.

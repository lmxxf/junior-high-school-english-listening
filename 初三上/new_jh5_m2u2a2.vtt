00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Thanksgiving.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
One.

00:04.000 --> 00:07.000
Thanksgiving is an American festival.

00:07.000 --> 00:11.000
It is celebrated on the fourth Thursday in November.

00:11.000 --> 00:16.000
It is a time for a special dinner among family and friends.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
People make short speeches and give thanks for their food.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
Two.

00:22.000 --> 00:28.000
We have celebrated the festival since the first pioneers from England

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
arrived in America by ship in the 17th century.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
While they were crossing the Atlantic, many people died.

00:36.000 --> 00:43.000
And after they landed, their first winter was worse than any English winter.

00:43.000 --> 00:51.000
The local people, the Native Americans, taught the pioneers how to grow corn.

00:51.000 --> 00:58.000
The following year, they celebrated together by eating a dinner of the new food.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Three.

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
We still celebrate Thanksgiving today with a traditional dinner.

01:05.000 --> 01:13.000
The kitchen is always the most crowded room in our house because we all help prepare the food.

01:13.000 --> 01:20.000
We lay the table and then, before we begin dinner, my father gives thanks for the food.

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
So, we remember why we celebrate the festival.

01:25.000 --> 01:31.000
We usually eat too much, but it is only once a year.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.000
We often talk a lot and tell stories after dinner as well.

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
When it is all over, everyone helps wash the dishes.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
Four.

01:44.000 --> 01:52.000
The festival is a very busy time for travel when friends and families come together to celebrate.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
During the festival, there are plenty of other things to see and do.

01:57.000 --> 02:04.000
We live in New York City and we go to watch the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade.

02:04.000 --> 02:12.000
The parade goes along several streets and finishes at the famous Macy's store.

02:13.000 --> 02:20.000
Thanksgiving is the start of the Christmas season and we start shopping for presents.

02:20.000 --> 02:27.000
Football is also important at Thanksgiving with many teams playing games.

02:27.000 --> 02:36.000
Like many Americans, we usually watch the games on television and enjoy ourselves very much.

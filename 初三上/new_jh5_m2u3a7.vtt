Hi Tom, hi Mike. Have you got plans for the holiday? Are you going somewhere nice?

00:07.000 --> 00:16.000
Yes, my family and I are going to Sangya. We go there every year. It's our favourite place.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Tom's coming with us.

00:18.000 --> 00:25.000
I'm really looking forward to it. I've never been there before. What about you Becky?

00:25.000 --> 00:32.000
We're staying at home this time. My grandparents are coming for a visit. I'm really excited.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
It's been a long time since I saw them last.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
Are you going to do anything special while they're here?

00:40.000 --> 00:48.000
They want to see Beijing. My father only has one day off, so he'll take us all to the great wall.

00:48.000 --> 00:54.000
Then my mother and I will take them all over the city. What about you Jane?

00:54.000 --> 01:01.000
I'm taking my American friend to visit my family in Shang Chi province.

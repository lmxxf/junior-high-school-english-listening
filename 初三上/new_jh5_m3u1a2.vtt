Hello, you're listening to our heroes. Today I have Chao Minh with me, and we are talking about Dong Yaping.

00:12.000 --> 00:18.000
Welcome, Chao Minh. Why did you choose to talk about Dong Yaping?

00:18.000 --> 00:28.000
Well, I love table tennis, and Dong Yaping is my favorite table tennis player in China, so I chose her.

00:28.000 --> 00:40.000
What can you tell us about her life? Well, she was born in 1973, and she was only 13 when she won her first national competition.

She's not tall, but her success made everyone in China very proud.

Doming, who is your hero? Who have you chosen to tell us about?

00:06.320 --> 00:13.700
Dung Yap-pung. She's my hero because she's one of the best table tennis players in the

00:13.700 --> 00:18.320
world and I love playing table tennis.

00:18.320 --> 00:25.840
Tell us about her. Well, she started playing table tennis when she was five. She trained

00:25.840 --> 00:32.680
hard so she became a great player later. And what competitions has she won?

00:32.680 --> 00:40.520
She's won many world competitions including four gold medals in the Olympics. She stopped

00:40.520 --> 00:45.840
playing when she was twenty-four. What did she do after that?

00:45.840 --> 00:55.200
She began to study at Ching Hua University in Beijing and then attended university abroad.

00:55.200 --> 01:03.100
Her English wasn't good enough when she began. Once again, she worked hard and seven years

01:03.100 --> 01:11.200
later she completed her doctor's degree at Cambridge University. Whatever she does, she

01:11.200 --> 01:20.280
never gives up. That's amazing. Yes. Dung says that she isn't cleverer than anyone else

01:20.280 --> 01:28.560
but she has a very strong will. I see. Well, I think she's a good student as well as a good

01:28.560 --> 01:36.240
player. Yes. And she helped make the Beijing Olympics a victory for world sport. She's

01:36.240 --> 01:39.760
simply the best. She's a true hero.

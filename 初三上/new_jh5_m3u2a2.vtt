Dr Norman Bethune

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
By Wang Ling Ling

00:09.000 --> 00:14.000
Norman Bethune is one of the most famous heroes in China.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
He was a Canadian doctor.

00:16.000 --> 00:23.000
He came to China to help the Chinese people and died for them.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
Norman Bethune was born in 1890.

00:27.000 --> 00:37.000
He became a doctor in 1916 and went to Spain in 1936 to treat the wounded soldiers during the war there.

00:37.000 --> 00:45.000
He soon realised that many people were dying because they did not get to hospital quickly enough.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
Dr Bethune developed new ways of taking care of the sick.

00:50.000 --> 01:01.000
He invented special medical tools to use outside hospitals and close to the fighting areas so that doctors could treat the wounded more quickly.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
His inventions saved many lives.

01:05.000 --> 01:14.000
In 1938, Dr Bethune came to China and helped treat the wounded during the anti-Japanese war.

01:14.000 --> 01:21.000
At that time, there were few doctors so he had to work very hard on his own.

01:21.000 --> 01:26.000
His experience of treating people in Spain was useful in China.

01:26.000 --> 01:36.000
He developed training courses for local doctors and nurses and wrote books so that they could learn about how he treated the sick.

01:36.000 --> 01:43.000
Dr Bethune often worked very hard without resting or taking care of himself.

01:43.000 --> 01:53.000
Once, he even worked for 69 hours without stopping and managed to save over 100 lives.

01:53.000 --> 02:02.000
One day, in 1939, he cut his finger during an operation but he continued his work without treating it.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
In the end, he died of his wound.

02:06.000 --> 02:12.000
Dr Bethune's work for the Chinese people made him a hero in China.

02:12.000 --> 02:21.000
There are many books and films about him and he is still remembered in both China and Canada today.

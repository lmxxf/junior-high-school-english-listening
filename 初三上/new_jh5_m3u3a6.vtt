Stan Lee is a writer. He created many of our favorite heroes, Spider-Man, the incredible

00:09.240 --> 00:17.040
Hulk, and the Silver Surfer are just three of them. In his stories, the heroes always

00:17.040 --> 00:24.720
win in the end. When he was young, he loved to watch his favorite actors in films. He

00:24.720 --> 00:31.360
wanted to create cartoon people just like them. He thought they were heroes because they

00:31.360 --> 00:39.600
were brave and did not worry about danger. Real people in his life also helped Stan.

00:39.600 --> 00:47.480
His teacher told great stories and made him love reading. The books he read, especially

00:47.480 --> 00:55.840
books by famous writers like Charles Dickens and Mark Twain, made him want to write. His

00:55.840 --> 01:04.640
mother was always proud of him and told him his work was good. Children often ask Stan how

01:04.640 --> 01:13.960
they can become writers. He tells them to read. He says they should read everything, not

01:13.960 --> 01:21.760
just their favorite kinds of books or books by famous writers. He says that reading is the

01:21.760 --> 01:31.200
best way to learn to write. Stan hopes that teachers can make children want to learn. They can

01:31.200 --> 01:41.680
make history, geography, languages, and science exciting. He says teachers should be more like

01:41.680 --> 01:44.800
actors and make learning interesting.

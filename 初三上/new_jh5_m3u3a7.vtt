My favourite Greek hero is Odysseus. He is the main character in the Odyssey, a famous

00:09.400 --> 00:17.920
story by the Greek storyteller Homer. Odysseus and his friends go from Greece to Troy

00:17.920 --> 00:26.440
to fight. After ten years they win and are very proud of themselves. Then they set off

00:26.440 --> 00:35.760
for home, but on their way there is a great storm. They become lost and that is the start

00:35.760 --> 00:44.000
of their great adventures. While they are travelling they meet many strange people.

00:44.000 --> 00:51.920
Most of them want to hurt Odysseus and his friends, but a few help them. On one island

00:51.920 --> 01:00.880
a very big man with only one eye tries to kill them. During this fight Odysseus loses

01:00.880 --> 01:10.200
many of his friends, but he manages to get away. After ten years of fighting and ten

01:10.200 --> 01:17.760
more years on the way home Odysseus completes his journey and manages to get back to his

01:17.760 --> 01:26.960
own country alone. His wife and son are waiting for him to come back. However he looks so

01:26.960 --> 01:35.240
different that they fail to recognise him. After Odysseus saves his wife and son from

01:35.240 --> 01:43.480
some bad men, they finally know who he is. He is happy to be back home again after so

01:43.480 --> 01:52.920
many adventures. I like this story because it is interesting and exciting. I think Odysseus

01:52.920 --> 02:02.840
is a true hero. He is very clever and has a strong will. I also learn from him that great

02:02.840 --> 02:07.640
men never give up, no matter what difficulties they face.

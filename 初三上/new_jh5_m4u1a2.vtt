00:00.000 --> 00:04.460
Thanks for coming with us to the station, Betty.

00:04.460 --> 00:06.340
No problem.

00:06.340 --> 00:09.100
Will you be okay at home on your own?

00:09.100 --> 00:10.100
Yes, of course.

00:10.100 --> 00:13.460
I'll be fine, but I'll miss you.

00:13.460 --> 00:17.940
I'll miss you, too, and I'll call you every day.

00:17.940 --> 00:21.140
Well, we're a bit early.

00:21.140 --> 00:26.840
Take care of everything at home, Betty, and keep the flat, tidy, please.

00:26.840 --> 00:28.320
Don't worry.

00:28.320 --> 00:32.920
I'll keep it tidy so that you'll be proud of me when you get home.

00:32.920 --> 00:34.640
Look after yourself.

00:34.640 --> 00:36.400
Yes, I will.

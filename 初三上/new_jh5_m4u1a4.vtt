00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Now, what's our train number?

00:05.000 --> 00:08.000
T-27 to LASA.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
It's leaving from platform 2.

00:11.000 --> 00:18.000
The meeting in LASA is very important for us, but I'm sorry you can't come with us, Betty.

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
So am I, but I can't miss two weeks of school.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
Will you remember everything I've told you?

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
Be especially careful with the door.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
Shut it when you're in and lock it when you go out.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
Yes, Mom. I can look after myself.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
Although it won't be easy for me.

00:38.000 --> 00:43.000
Well, make sure you eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables.

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
And I've left lots of your favorite biscuits.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
Don't worry. I can cook simple meals.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
There won't be anybody to wake you up in the morning.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
I'll be fine.

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
My clock rings so loudly that it will certainly wake me up.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.000
I'm sure I've forgotten something, but I don't know what it is.

01:08.000 --> 01:18.000
Announcement. We advise all passengers for train T-27 to LASA to go immediately to platform 2.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
Your train is about to leave.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
That's your train. Goodbye, Mom. Goodbye, Dad.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
I know. I haven't given you our address in LASA.

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
Send me a text message. Have a good trip.

01:34.000 --> 01:39.000
Bye, my dear. Bye. See you in a couple of weeks.

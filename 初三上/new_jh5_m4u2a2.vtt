00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
My perfect holiday.

00:04.000 --> 00:09.200
As a boy, like all other boys, I wanted to be a man.

00:09.200 --> 00:12.200
But my parents did everything for me.

00:12.200 --> 00:16.960
Actually, they managed every minute of my life.

00:16.960 --> 00:21.880
Although they loved me, I felt a bit unhappy with them.

00:21.880 --> 00:25.160
John Chengu, do your homework.

00:25.160 --> 00:27.120
Practice the piano.

00:27.120 --> 00:29.720
Turn off the TV.

00:29.720 --> 00:36.600
I became so bored with their orders that I wished they would leave me alone.

00:36.600 --> 00:40.360
Well, my wish came true.

00:40.360 --> 00:46.320
Although my parents were very worried about leaving me, they had to go away on business

00:46.320 --> 00:48.520
for a few days.

00:48.520 --> 00:51.120
Now was my chance.

00:51.120 --> 00:54.960
I could have some fun at last.

00:54.960 --> 01:02.080
As soon as I got home from school the first day, I happily threw my school bag on the sofa

01:02.080 --> 01:04.680
and ate lots of snacks.

01:04.680 --> 01:09.680
Then, I enjoyed an exciting film on TV.

01:09.680 --> 01:13.600
And after that, I played computer games.

01:13.600 --> 01:19.840
I liked the games so much that I played until midnight.

01:19.840 --> 01:23.080
The next morning, I woke up late.

01:23.080 --> 01:29.960
I had to hurry to school without breakfast, but I was still late.

01:29.960 --> 01:36.600
The teacher asked me for my homework, but I could not hand it in.

01:36.600 --> 01:43.360
With an empty stomach, I was unable to play basketball with my classmates.

01:43.360 --> 01:49.680
I felt tired and sleepy at school all day long.

01:49.680 --> 01:55.160
When I got home, I tried to cook some rice, but I burnt it.

01:55.160 --> 02:00.080
I even dropped my father's cup when I was cooking.

02:00.080 --> 02:06.040
I found myself so bad at simple cooking tasks.

02:06.040 --> 02:08.880
I started to feel lonely.

02:08.880 --> 02:13.360
I wanted Mum and Dad to come home soon.

02:13.360 --> 02:20.640
Mum cooked such delicious food and made sure I never forgot my homework.

02:20.640 --> 02:29.000
Dad always helped me with any difficult questions and told funny jokes when I was unhappy.

02:29.000 --> 02:36.280
Then I realised being home alone was not always perfect.

02:36.280 --> 02:44.080
When my parents came home, they were happy to find that I could cook and tidy up now.

02:44.080 --> 02:48.560
I told them my home alone story and we all laughed.

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
What did you do when your parents were away, darming?

00:05.000 --> 00:09.000
I managed okay at home alone, although I missed them.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
What about you?

00:11.000 --> 00:18.000
Well, I depend on my mother for so many things that I found it difficult.

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
I'm so bad at cooking that I burnt everything.

00:22.000 --> 00:29.000
I was so hungry that I ate all the food my mother left on the first day.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
Then what did you do?

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
Well, I went shopping.

00:34.000 --> 00:39.000
I bought so much food that I could hardly carry at home.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
Did you cook for yourself?

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
Yes, I did.

00:43.000 --> 00:51.000
Although I already knew how to make some simple dishes, I called my grandmother for some advice.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
What did you do when you burnt your food?

00:54.000 --> 01:00.000
I added the student restaurant, but the food wasn't very good.

00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Betty, Lingling and Daming are on the second floor of a museum.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
What a wonderful museum!

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
It's great, isn't it?

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
Let's go to the animal room upstairs.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
I need some information for my project.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
Me too. Let's go.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
Wait! Where's Daming?

00:24.000 --> 00:25.000
There he is.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
What's he doing over there?

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
Hey, Betty! Lingling!

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
Come and see the monkey exhibition!

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
No shouting please. It's against the rules.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
Oh no. Daming is in trouble again.

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
Look at the monkey's tail! I've got to get in here!

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
Stop! Don't cross that rope.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
Can't you see the sign, kid? No entry.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
Oh, why not?

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
Because it's closed.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
Yes, Daming. Read the sign.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
Oh, right. That's no good.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
Well, I'll just take a photo.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
Sorry. No photos? See?

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
There certainly are a lot of rules in this museum.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
No wonder the place is empty.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
Daming! Don't be rude.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Oh no.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
What's the matter, Lingling?

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
My mobile phone. It's missing.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
Oh no. What am I going to do?

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
Don't worry, miss. Go downstairs to the lost and found office.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
They might have it.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
That phone isn't you.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
I have to find it. Or Mum will punish me.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
I'm sure it will be all right, Lingling.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
Let's go and see.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
Yes. Let's go downstairs.

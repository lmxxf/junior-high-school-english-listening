The Science Museum in London

00:03.080 --> 00:05.120
By Tony Smith

00:06.160 --> 00:10.920
Welcome to the most friendly museum in London.

00:10.920 --> 00:16.360
In most museums there is no shouting and no running

00:16.360 --> 00:19.560
and you must not touch anything.

00:19.560 --> 00:23.520
But the Science Museum is different.

00:23.520 --> 00:25.760
It is noisy.

00:26.240 --> 00:30.960
People talk about what they can see and do here.

00:30.960 --> 00:36.000
And there are some very noisy machines as well.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.800
If you want answers to all your questions about science,

00:40.800 --> 00:44.840
this is the right place for you.

00:44.840 --> 00:50.720
I like to visit the rooms on the second and third floors.

00:50.720 --> 00:55.440
You can learn about communications and the environment

00:55.480 --> 01:00.680
as well as maths, physics and chemistry.

01:00.680 --> 01:06.480
For example, you can find out how people dig coal from the ground

01:06.480 --> 01:09.920
and use it to create energy.

01:09.920 --> 01:14.280
And in one room they even explain how X-rays

01:14.280 --> 01:18.680
let you see inside your body.

01:18.680 --> 01:23.840
The launch pad on the third floor is the most popular room

01:23.880 --> 01:30.880
and it is my favourite too because there are lots of physics experiments.

01:30.880 --> 01:35.280
For example, if you want to fill a bag with sand

01:35.280 --> 01:39.320
you have to control a kind of truck on wheels

01:39.320 --> 01:43.160
and move it into the correct place.

01:43.160 --> 01:50.640
You can also find out how people travel into space and back again.

01:50.680 --> 01:58.000
On the fourth and fifth floors you can learn about what medicine was like in the past.

01:58.000 --> 02:03.240
If you compare the medicine of the past with the medicine of today

02:03.240 --> 02:09.840
you will feel very lucky next time you visit a doctor.

02:09.840 --> 02:15.440
The Science Museum is interesting for people of all ages.

02:15.440 --> 02:21.640
You can always find something new and have a wonderful time there.

02:21.640 --> 02:29.560
The museum is free to enter so you can go in for a few minutes or stay all day.

02:29.560 --> 02:34.840
It is open daily from 10am to 6pm.

02:34.840 --> 02:41.640
So if you ever go to London make sure you visit the Science Museum.

02:41.640 --> 02:46.440
It is my favourite museum in the whole world.

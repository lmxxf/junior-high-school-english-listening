00:00.000 --> 00:06.540
The museum is very big, so be careful you don't get lost.

00:06.540 --> 00:12.020
Take one of these little books with information about where everything is.

00:12.020 --> 00:18.000
If you want to leave your coats and bags, there's a special room on the ground floor next

00:18.000 --> 00:20.980
to the ticket office.

00:20.980 --> 00:26.500
There are toilets on each floor, at the bottom of the stairs.

00:26.500 --> 00:32.480
Next on this floor, there are things on show from the natural world, about different

00:32.480 --> 00:35.520
countries and geography.

00:35.520 --> 00:42.240
Then upstairs, you will see things like old rocks, as well as dishes and bowls from long

00:42.240 --> 00:43.240
ago.

00:43.240 --> 00:47.160
They all come from the ancient world.

00:47.160 --> 00:53.240
After that, we'll go upstairs again to the second floor, to see the wonders of the

00:53.240 --> 00:55.440
modern world.

00:55.440 --> 00:59.060
There's also an exhibition of modern technology.

00:59.060 --> 01:05.560
Finally, on the top floor, there is a restaurant, so you can relax and have a meal or a drink.

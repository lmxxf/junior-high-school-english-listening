00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
What's that music?

00:04.000 --> 00:07.000
It's Tony. He's playing the guitar.

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
He spends a lot of time playing the guitar. Has he done his homework?

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
Probably not. But all his friends are learning to play an instrument.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
He wants to play with them.

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
I don't want to stop him enjoying music, but he's got to study as well.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
If he doesn't work hard, he'll fail his exams.

00:30.000 --> 00:37.000
Let's make a deal with him. We'll pay for guitar lessons if he works hard at school.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
Okay. That's a good idea.

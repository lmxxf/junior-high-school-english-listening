Tony, you are playing the guitar again. Have you done your homework?

00:08.000 --> 00:15.320
No, not yet, but I haven't got much. If I start after dinner, I'll finish it before

00:15.320 --> 00:21.000
I go to bed. Anyway, you wanted me to learn an instrument.

00:21.000 --> 00:28.440
I want you to get into the habit of doing your homework as soon as you come home from school.

00:28.440 --> 00:32.440
If you start now, you'll finish it before dinner.

00:32.440 --> 00:40.360
Yes, but I need a rest from schoolwork. I also want to go to the library to do volunteer

00:40.360 --> 00:41.360
work.

00:41.360 --> 00:45.200
So you're not going to do your homework now?

00:45.200 --> 00:50.440
No, it isn't necessary to do it now. I'll do it later.

00:50.440 --> 00:56.040
That's a shame. I really don't think you should go to the library so much.

00:56.040 --> 01:03.040
Why not? I can work in the library and I'm also able to read books there.

01:03.040 --> 01:09.640
No deal, Tony. If you do all these other things, instead of your homework, you won't have

01:09.640 --> 01:11.640
time to study.

01:11.640 --> 01:17.440
You mean you don't want me to help the community and increase my knowledge of the world?

01:17.440 --> 01:24.200
That's not the point. You should consider what the most important thing is. I don't

01:24.200 --> 01:31.200
want you to fail your exams, but you can't do anything before you finish your homework.

01:31.200 --> 01:35.200
I'm sorry, but that's my last word.

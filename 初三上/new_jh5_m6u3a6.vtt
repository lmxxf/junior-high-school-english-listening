I want to take part in the school violin competition this year, but I am not sure whether I should

00:08.360 --> 00:17.120
or not. I practice the violin for three hours every day, however I have never won a prize,

00:17.120 --> 00:23.840
although I have entered the competition several times. I came fourth last year, that was my

00:23.840 --> 00:33.760
best. I feel quite unhappy with the result. I wonder if I should just give up. Kate.

00:33.760 --> 00:42.400
B. My best friend Linda and I both love acting and singing. I have just found out that I have

00:42.400 --> 00:50.480
got the biggest part in the school play. Linda has only got a small part. She is not happy about it.

00:51.440 --> 00:58.800
I feel sorry for her. I know she wants me to refuse the big part. She says that is what a good friend

00:58.800 --> 01:09.840
should do, but it is really important to me. What should I do? Susan. See, my friend Peter

01:09.840 --> 01:19.040
finds maths very difficult. He wants me to let him copy my homework. I want to refuse because I do

01:19.040 --> 01:26.000
not think it is honest to do that, but I do not want Peter to get into trouble with his parents.

01:27.040 --> 01:34.080
They have warned him about not working hard, but he does work hard. It is just that he does not

01:34.080 --> 01:37.120
understand the work. Jack.

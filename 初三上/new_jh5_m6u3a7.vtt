How can I help you?

00:02.000 --> 00:07.000
Well, I find it very difficult to get to sleep at night.

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
I go to bed late and I'm usually tired, but then I stay awake for hours.

00:13.000 --> 00:21.000
I see. Don't worry. This is a problem that a lot of teenagers have because your minds are very active.

00:21.000 --> 00:29.000
The problem is I fall asleep very late and in the morning when I have to get up and go to school, I'm too tired.

00:29.000 --> 00:36.000
Yes, that's a problem. And you do need enough sleep when you're still growing.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
What do you suggest?

00:38.000 --> 00:47.000
Make sure you take enough exercise and eat healthy food and find ways to relax before you go to bed.

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
For example, have a hot shower and a warm drink.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
Is there anything that I shouldn't do?

00:55.000 --> 01:04.000
Well, too much sugar will keep you awake. Don't watch television or play on the computer before you go to bed.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
These will keep your mind active.

01:07.000 --> 01:14.000
And another thing, it's important to go to bed early at the same time every night.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
Thanks. I'll take your advice and try.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Good luck.

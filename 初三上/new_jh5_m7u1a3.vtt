Hello, Betty. What's up?

00:03.000 --> 00:09.000
I want to join an internet group to discuss great books by great writers.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
So, who are your great writers?

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
Well, maybe Confucius and Shakespeare.

00:17.000 --> 00:25.000
Really? I accept that their greats because their works are still read by many people today,

00:25.000 --> 00:32.000
but I think I'd describe Confucius more as a teacher and thinker than a writer.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
He was a very wise man.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
What do you have to do for the discussion?

00:38.000 --> 00:45.000
Well, each of us reads a favourite book and writes a review for the discussion.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
I see. We're still influenced by Confucius' ideas,

00:50.000 --> 00:56.000
and Shakespeare's plays also make a lot of sense to us today.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.000
People have always read and will always read great books.

01:02.000 --> 01:10.000
By the way, what do you think of Mark Twain, the great American writer in the 19th century?

01:10.000 --> 01:17.000
He was important, but I suppose he isn't as well known as Confucius or Shakespeare.

01:17.000 --> 01:27.000
No, but his books are still popular, and one of his books is my favourite, the adventures of Tom Sawyer.

01:27.000 --> 01:33.000
Great. Why don't you join in the discussion and tell us about it?

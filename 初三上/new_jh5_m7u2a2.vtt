00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
A book review of the Adventures of Tom Sawyer.

00:05.000 --> 00:11.240
One of my favorite great books is The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain.

00:11.240 --> 00:19.240
The story is said in the town of St. Petersburg, Missouri, in the US, in the 19th century.

00:19.240 --> 00:24.840
It tells some exciting stories about a boy who has many adventures.

00:24.840 --> 00:29.680
Tom, the hero of the book, lives with his aunt Polly.

00:29.760 --> 00:32.720
He is a lively and clever boy.

00:32.720 --> 00:39.120
He does not like people telling him what to do, so he always gets into trouble.

00:39.120 --> 00:46.760
He and his best friend, Huck Finn, run away to an island in the middle of the Mississippi River.

00:46.760 --> 00:53.320
Tom has more trouble because a bad man named Ingen Joe is looking for him.

00:53.320 --> 00:58.840
Later, Tom escapes from a cave with another friend, Becky.

00:58.920 --> 01:03.480
He also finds Ingen Joe's treasure box and takes it away.

01:03.480 --> 01:11.680
My favorite part of the book is when Tom and Huck start their adventures on the island in the Mississippi River.

01:11.680 --> 01:14.400
At first, they are happy.

01:14.400 --> 01:20.960
But when they hear that everyone thinks they are dead, they feel very sorry, so they come back home.

01:20.960 --> 01:28.520
They hide and watch for time when they see their family and neighbors coming to their funeral in the church.

01:28.560 --> 01:32.560
Then, Tom and Huck suddenly appear.

01:32.560 --> 01:39.720
Everyone is surprised to see them at first, but very pleased to find that they are alive.

01:39.720 --> 01:43.280
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is a great book.

01:43.280 --> 01:46.480
It is more than an adventure story.

01:46.480 --> 01:51.280
Mark Twain wrote it in 1876.

01:51.280 --> 01:57.240
It describes people's lives in the southern states of America at that time.

01:57.280 --> 02:05.920
It tells how young people grow, how people love each other, and how bad people pay for their actions.

02:05.920 --> 02:12.520
It is written in everyday English, and the dialogue sound especially real.

02:12.520 --> 02:17.720
Today, it is still read and loved by people all over the world,

02:17.720 --> 02:22.720
and it is thought to be one of the greatest American stories.

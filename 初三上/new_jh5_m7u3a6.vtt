This is a good book, Doming. It's called The Arabian Nights. Have you read it?

00:08.000 --> 00:19.000
Yes, but I didn't like it. The king is told a different story each night, but I thought it was quite long and boring.

00:19.000 --> 00:29.000
Oh, really? I loved it. What about this one? It's about a house with something strange in it.

00:29.000 --> 00:43.000
Oh, no. I didn't like that. Oh, really? Well, what about this story? It looks exciting. It's about a boat trip on a river.

00:43.000 --> 00:58.000
Yes, that book is wonderful. I read it last week. Here's another one. Oh, look. It's got a baby duck and a baby pig on the front. They're so sweet.

00:58.000 --> 01:07.000
That book is only for babies, Betty. I don't want to read baby picture books. You're right.

01:07.000 --> 01:21.000
Well, how about this one about China? It looks interesting. I agree. I read that and I liked it. It's got some great photos.

01:21.000 --> 01:35.000
And have you read this? It looks very interesting. Yes, I have. And I really enjoyed it. The writer visits different places and interviews the people there.

01:35.000 --> 01:43.000
They talk about how their lives have changed. You should read it. I think I will.

When do you hold your basketball matches? Every Saturday.

00:06.000 --> 00:11.000
Who's allowed to play in the Beijing Schools Basketball Competition?

00:11.000 --> 00:20.000
If a school team in Beijing wins a match or scores over 50 points in a match, it can play in the competition.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
And what's your team called?

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
B-I-G.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
What does B-I-G stand for?

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
Beijing International Giants.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
I think we'll win the competition.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
And our fans think we're fantastic.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
Well, good luck.

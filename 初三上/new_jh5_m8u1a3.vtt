00:00.000 --> 00:04.720
Hi Tony, you look tired.

00:04.720 --> 00:09.040
Yes, I'm training for the big match next week.

00:09.040 --> 00:11.440
Who are you playing against?

00:11.440 --> 00:13.800
H-A-S.

00:13.800 --> 00:17.600
What does H-A-S stand for?

00:17.600 --> 00:19.640
High D-N All Stars.

00:19.640 --> 00:23.440
Oh yes, it'll be a difficult match.

00:23.440 --> 00:25.760
Didn't they beat you last time?

00:25.760 --> 00:27.800
Yes, they did, butâ€¦

00:27.800 --> 00:29.880
What was the score?

00:29.880 --> 00:38.800
If my memory is correct, H-A-S 98 points to B-I-G 52.

00:38.800 --> 00:43.160
But Darming wasn't chosen for the team last time.

00:43.160 --> 00:45.360
That was a bad decision.

00:45.360 --> 00:48.240
We can't play well without him.

00:48.240 --> 00:50.200
That's no excuse.

00:50.200 --> 00:52.760
But Darming is back now.

00:52.760 --> 00:57.320
There's no difference between the two teams this season.

00:57.320 --> 00:59.080
When is the match?

00:59.080 --> 01:01.480
It's next Saturday at noon.

01:01.480 --> 01:05.560
But if you want good seats, you should come by 1130.

01:05.560 --> 01:07.680
Are you coming?

01:07.680 --> 01:09.720
I'm not sure.

01:09.720 --> 01:12.040
Do you think they'll win Ling Ling?

01:12.040 --> 01:14.400
No way.

01:14.400 --> 01:19.240
How many matches have you played against H-A-S this year?

01:19.240 --> 01:22.360
Well, about three.

01:22.360 --> 01:27.280
And how many have H-A-S won?

01:27.280 --> 01:28.280
Most of them?

01:28.280 --> 01:29.280
Wrong.

01:29.280 --> 01:30.800
All of them.

01:30.800 --> 01:33.160
Face the truth, Tony.

01:33.160 --> 01:35.040
You've got no chance.

01:35.040 --> 01:36.560
I don't agree.

01:36.560 --> 01:38.360
That's not fair.

01:38.360 --> 01:41.200
Tony leaves angrily.

01:41.200 --> 01:43.400
Remember to throw the ball.

01:43.400 --> 01:46.040
Not kick it, Tony.

01:46.040 --> 01:51.280
He's so mad at us that he'll try harder to win just to show we're wrong.

01:51.280 --> 01:53.240
Nice work, Betty.

01:53.240 --> 01:56.280
I do hope they win this time.

01:56.280 --> 01:58.040
We'll be there to cheer for them.

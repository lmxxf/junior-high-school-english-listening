00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Liu Xiyang trained to be the best in the world.

00:05.000 --> 00:12.000
For Liu Xiyang, life as a sports hero began in 2004.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.500
First, he was invited to competitions around the world.

00:16.500 --> 00:25.000
Then, he was chosen for the Chinese team at the Athens Olympic Games and won a gold medal.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.500
Liu Xiyang was not a successful sportsman at first.

00:29.500 --> 00:39.000
He was born in Shanghai on the 13th of July 1983 and started training when he was very young.

00:39.000 --> 00:46.500
In grade four, he went to the sports school of Poutua District of Shanghai.

00:46.500 --> 00:51.000
Liu was encouraged at first to train for the high jump.

00:51.500 --> 01:03.000
In 1998, Liu Xiyang's ability in herdling was noticed by Sun Hai Ping, who later became his coach.

01:03.000 --> 01:10.000
In 2001, a special program was set up to help young sportsmen and sports women.

01:10.000 --> 01:19.000
Liu Xiyang was among them. His races were recorded and he was compared with the world's best sports stars.

01:19.000 --> 01:26.500
Sun Hai Ping used the information to change his training methods for Liu Xiyang.

01:26.500 --> 01:36.500
In May 2001, Liu Xiyang won his first international 110-meter hurdles race in Japan.

01:36.500 --> 01:48.000
In 2004, he won the first Olympic gold medal for China in the 110-meter hurdles race and at the same time broke the Olympic Games record.

01:48.000 --> 01:57.500
It was also the first time an Olympic gold medal for herdling was hung round the neck of a sportsperson from an Asian country.

01:57.500 --> 02:05.500
Liu Xiyang trained very hard. In fact, he trained so hard that he hurt his foot.

02:05.500 --> 02:12.000
From 2008 on, he suffered a lot from his foot problem, but he did not give up.

02:12.000 --> 02:22.000
Though he missed some competitions, he still returned to first place in the world 110-meter hurdles race in 2012.

02:22.000 --> 02:35.000
It is a pity that his foot problem stopped him from completing the 2012 London Olympic Games, but he is still a symbol of courage and success, and we continue to take great pride in him.

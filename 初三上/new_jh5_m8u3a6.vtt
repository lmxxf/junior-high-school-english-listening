Hi, Betty. What are you doing?

00:03.580 --> 00:09.720
Hi, darling. I'm trying to find out about Chunchong for my project.

00:09.720 --> 00:12.560
She's very good at Taekwondo.

00:12.560 --> 00:18.320
Really? So what have you discovered about her on the internet?

00:18.320 --> 00:24.260
Well, she was born in 1982 and she's from her nun.

00:24.500 --> 00:30.660
She was once a basketball player before she changed to Taekwondo.

00:30.660 --> 00:33.540
That is unusual, isn't it?

00:33.540 --> 00:39.940
I mean, to give up a popular sport like basketball to do Taekwondo.

00:39.940 --> 00:42.900
Yes, I think so too.

00:42.900 --> 00:47.380
And at first, she didn't think it was the right decision.

00:47.380 --> 00:51.540
She found the Taekwondo training very difficult.

00:51.540 --> 00:55.140
In fact, she almost gave up.

00:55.140 --> 01:00.660
But she was encouraged by her mother to continue with training.

01:00.660 --> 01:05.220
And in the end, she was successful.

01:05.220 --> 01:08.820
Was she in the Chinese team at the Olympics?

01:08.820 --> 01:16.020
Yes. She won a gold medal in Sydney and then another one in Athens.

01:16.020 --> 01:20.980
Look at the photo. She was cheered by everyone.

01:20.980 --> 01:24.260
She was so happy that she hugged her coach

01:24.260 --> 01:29.300
and wore the Chinese national flag on her shoulders.

What do you think, Betty? Which of these inventions is the most important?

00:08.000 --> 00:14.000
It's difficult to say. They've all changed people's lives.

00:14.000 --> 00:21.000
I love my mobile phone because I can use it anywhere. It's so useful.

00:21.000 --> 00:29.000
Yes. All my friends' numbers are kept in my phone so I don't need a notebook.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.000
Today's cameras are better than old cameras because they don't need film.

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
Yes, and the photos can be sent by email.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.000
Well, I think everything was changed by computers to some degree.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
So, I think the computer is the most important invention.

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
I agree. I can't imagine living without one.

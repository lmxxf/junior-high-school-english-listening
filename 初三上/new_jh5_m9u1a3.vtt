00:00.000 --> 00:04.320
Dad, can I borrow your camera?

00:04.320 --> 00:05.560
Why?

00:05.560 --> 00:11.280
I'd like to take some photos on the school visit to the museum next week.

00:11.280 --> 00:16.840
They'll be put up on the school website and they can be seen on the internet by other

00:16.840 --> 00:21.720
classes, even people living in other countries.

00:21.720 --> 00:22.720
Sounds great.

00:22.720 --> 00:28.960
When I was at school, we waited for weeks to hear from our pen friends abroad.

00:28.960 --> 00:34.560
But today we can send and receive photos and emails on the internet and it's really

00:34.560 --> 00:35.560
fast.

00:35.560 --> 00:41.960
Yes, the internet and the computer have changed our lives.

00:41.960 --> 00:46.640
We even use online text books in our class.

00:46.640 --> 00:53.000
I wonder, will computers be used more than books in the future?

00:53.000 --> 00:58.120
Perhaps in the past we mainly got information from paper books.

00:58.120 --> 01:01.840
Some were huge ones with thousands of pages.

01:01.840 --> 01:07.240
Today with the invention of the computer and electronic technology, it's easy to get

01:07.240 --> 01:09.600
information on the internet.

01:09.600 --> 01:12.480
The internet is more powerful than books.

01:12.480 --> 01:14.840
Anyway, about the camera.

01:14.840 --> 01:17.480
Oh yes, here it is.

01:17.480 --> 01:23.160
I haven't used it since your mum's birthday and the memory card may be full.

01:23.160 --> 01:25.360
Okay, that can be fixed.

01:25.360 --> 01:28.360
I've got an empty memory card.

01:28.360 --> 01:30.160
Where are the instructions?

01:30.160 --> 01:31.920
In the camera bag.

01:31.920 --> 01:34.680
It's a gift from your mum for my birthday.

01:34.680 --> 01:38.480
So you must promise that you'll take good care of it.

01:38.480 --> 01:43.160
If you have to lend it to anyone, tell them to use it properly.

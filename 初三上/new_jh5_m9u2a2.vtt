00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Will books be replaced by the internet?

00:03.800 --> 00:04.800
1.

00:05.920 --> 00:10.800
Every morning, my father buys a newspaper on his way to work.

00:11.120 --> 00:16.000
Every day, I open my books in class and start my lessons.

00:16.560 --> 00:21.000
Every evening, my mother looks through magazines at home.

00:21.320 --> 00:29.800
And every night, I look at the photos of David Beckham and Yao Ming on my bedroom wall before I go to sleep.

00:30.600 --> 00:34.600
Can we imagine life without paper or printing?

00:35.920 --> 00:36.920
2.

00:38.200 --> 00:43.800
Paper was first created about 2,000 years ago in China.

00:44.400 --> 00:50.400
After its invention, people started to write on paper to make books.

00:51.600 --> 00:56.600
In those days, books were only produced one at a time by hand.

00:57.200 --> 01:01.600
As a result, there were not many books and they were expensive.

01:02.200 --> 01:06.200
So, few people had the chance to learn to read.

01:07.400 --> 01:08.400
3.

01:09.600 --> 01:14.800
Printing was invented in China during the Sway and Tang Dynasty.

01:16.000 --> 01:23.000
Later, developments in printing made it possible to produce books more quickly and cheaply.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.800
A trade in books resulted and more people learnt to read.

01:29.600 --> 01:33.800
Knowledge and ideas spread faster than ever before.

01:34.600 --> 01:43.400
In a way, we can compare the invention of paper and printing to the introduction of the internet in the 20th century.

01:44.600 --> 01:45.600
4.

01:46.200 --> 01:54.200
Although the internet is still young, it is growing very fast and may become more powerful than printing.

01:55.400 --> 02:03.000
A much larger amount of information can be stored in more varied forms on the internet than in books.

02:04.000 --> 02:12.000
Someone with an internet connection can find information much more easily than they can find it in printed forms.

02:12.600 --> 02:21.600
And the machines we used to read it are now small and light, often smaller and lighter than a single book.

02:22.600 --> 02:23.600
5.

02:24.600 --> 02:33.600
Computers and the internet are used in classrooms now, and newspapers and magazines are already read online.

02:34.200 --> 02:39.000
So what direction will traditional printing take in the future?

02:39.600 --> 02:42.600
Will books be replaced by the internet?

02:43.200 --> 02:44.400
Let's wait and see.

After printing was invented, knowledge was spread around the world by books.

00:06.640 --> 00:10.800
For many years books were very expensive.

00:10.800 --> 00:16.240
Each one was written by hand, so very few books were produced.

00:16.240 --> 00:19.760
Today books are produced quickly.

00:19.760 --> 00:23.840
They're light, cheap and easy to get hold of.

00:23.840 --> 00:29.440
But the early books are now too valuable to be picked up and held in the hand.

00:29.440 --> 00:36.000
So here in the British Library, they were copied onto a computer a few years ago.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.320
Have a look at the screen here.

00:38.320 --> 00:43.840
You can turn the pages on the screen without touching the real books.

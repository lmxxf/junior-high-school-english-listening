The Internet has been around for many years, but it was the invention of the Worldwide Web

00:08.040 --> 00:11.040
that made it really useful to people.

00:11.040 --> 00:17.400
Together the Internet and the Worldwide Web have changed the world.

00:17.400 --> 00:24.520
The Internet was invented by the US government in the 1960s for the Army to use.

00:24.520 --> 00:31.080
In the 1970s, scientists and business people also wanted to use the Internet to send and

00:31.080 --> 00:33.400
receive messages.

00:33.400 --> 00:38.120
For some years people could only send very simple texts.

00:38.120 --> 00:42.880
They could not send photos or documents by the Internet.

00:42.880 --> 00:51.400
That changed in 1991 when a British scientist named Tim Berners-Lee invented the Worldwide

00:51.400 --> 00:53.080
Web.

00:53.080 --> 01:00.920
The Worldwide Web allows people to send various types of files, such as texts, photos and

01:00.920 --> 01:09.000
videos by the Internet, so more and more people started to use it in the 1990s.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.720
Today the Web has hundreds of millions of users.

01:13.720 --> 01:19.320
It has changed the way people live, work and play.

01:19.320 --> 01:25.800
Through the Internet, email allows us to communicate nearly instantly with people thousands

01:25.800 --> 01:28.120
of miles away.

01:28.120 --> 01:34.280
People and businesses use e-commerce and online shopping to buy and sell things across

01:34.280 --> 01:36.080
the world.

01:36.080 --> 01:43.320
The Web also makes people's lives easier, because now many things can be done from home,

01:43.320 --> 01:45.720
24 hours a day.

01:45.720 --> 01:52.320
The Web can help you do research for your homework, so that you do not need to go to the library.

01:52.320 --> 01:58.960
You can use Internet banking instead of going to the bank, and of course people just surf

01:58.960 --> 02:02.760
the Web when they want to relax.

02:02.760 --> 02:08.440
Technology changes quickly, and it is hard to imagine what the future of the Internet and

02:08.440 --> 02:14.320
the Web will be, but it seems impossible to imagine life without them.

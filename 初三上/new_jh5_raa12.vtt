Hi, how are you all? You know I am going to China soon for a two-week holiday and I am

00:09.000 --> 00:15.200
really looking forward to seeing you all. Of course, I really want to see some of the

00:15.200 --> 00:22.200
famous places there, like the Great Wall, and I know that there are a lot of other ancient

00:22.200 --> 00:29.900
buildings and beautiful places to see. I recently read about the big changes in China over

00:29.900 --> 00:37.900
the past few years. The new cities have grown so quickly and the old cities have changed so much,

00:37.900 --> 00:45.900
so I am sure there will be a lot to see. Please can you each suggest some places to go so that I

00:45.900 --> 00:55.900
can have a perfect holiday? Lots of love, Tina. Hi, Tina. For me, the best place to visit is

00:55.900 --> 01:05.900
Shen Jin. It is an exciting and fast-moving new city in the south of China. You can get a very good idea of

01:05.900 --> 01:14.900
modern China if you go there. You can also visit an old city like Nanjing. Nanjing has changed a lot

01:14.900 --> 01:23.900
over the past 20 years. You can see the old and new buildings standing side by side there, and many of the

01:23.900 --> 01:31.900
older buildings now look beautiful because workers have carefully made them look as good as new. Looking

01:31.900 --> 01:42.900
forward to seeing you soon, Hong Mei. Hi, Tina. It is great to hear you are coming to China. Let's travel

01:42.900 --> 01:51.900
around together and visit some interesting places. I would really like to go to Sian. I have never been there

01:51.900 --> 02:01.900
before. If we go there, we will get the chance to see the Terracotta Army. There are also a lot of other

02:01.900 --> 02:11.900
places of interest in this city because it has a long history. Let me know when you will arrive and I can plan our trip.

02:11.900 --> 02:20.900
Lots of love, Fan Tsing. Hello, Tina. What good news. At last you are coming to visit us here

02:20.900 --> 02:32.900
in China. I know you are really interested in animals, so I suggest that we visit Chengdu, a beautiful city in Sichuan province.

02:32.900 --> 02:45.900
We can see pandas in the park near Chengdu. We can also visit Dufu's Thatched Cottage, Dufu Cao Tang, one of my favourite places there.

02:45.900 --> 02:57.900
Dufu was one of the most famous poets in Chinese history. He lived there for some years. After he died, it became a place for people to remember him.

02:57.900 --> 03:11.900
It is a traditional Chinese garden as well as a beautiful and quiet place, excellent for reading and thinking. I hope you like my suggestions. Love way, way.

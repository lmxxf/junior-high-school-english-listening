Hi, Darming. Did you have a good day yesterday?

00:04.000 --> 00:09.000
Yes, I went to the museum. Have you ever been there?

00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
Yes, but I haven't been there for a long time.

00:13.000 --> 00:17.000
I thought it was really good, especially the technology room.

00:17.000 --> 00:23.000
They've opened a new room now, the Wonder Room, and it's even better.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.000
What's it about?

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
It's about the wonders of the world, ancient as well as modern.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.000
I spent a long time there because there's so much information about the world.

00:35.000 --> 00:42.000
After that, I went to the technology room, and then upstairs to the print room.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
Is that all about the history of printing?

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
Yes, it is. And next to that is the space room.

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
It's also very good, and it's about space travel.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
I bet you went to the restaurants after that.

00:59.000 --> 01:07.000
Of course. And then I went back upstairs to have a look at the library on the top floor.

01:07.000 --> 01:14.000
But before I left the museum, I went into the shop and bought you this.

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
It's a book about the history of the Olympic Games in ancient Greece.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
Thanks, darming. That's really kind of you.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
You know I'm interested in the story of the Olympics.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.000
Well, you should go and visit the museum then, and find out even more about it.

00:00.000 --> 00:03.400
The School of the Air

00:03.400 --> 00:12.400
My name is Belinda Black. I am 13 years old and I come from Mount Elm sheep station in South Australia.

00:12.400 --> 00:22.400
I have got two sisters. Jennifer is 11 and Lisa is 7. We are all pupils at the School of the Air.

00:22.400 --> 00:31.800
The School of the Air is a school for children who live far from the cities and who are in a place which does not have a local school.

00:31.800 --> 00:37.400
So we have air lessons over the radio or on the computer.

00:37.400 --> 00:45.400
Our teachers are at Port Augusta, a city which is about 160 kilometres away.

00:45.800 --> 00:52.800
In the morning we go to our classroom at 8.45. It is really just a small building.

00:52.800 --> 00:58.800
When we get there we turn on the radio or computer and listen to what we should do.

00:58.800 --> 01:03.200
From then until 12 we just do our usual lessons.

01:03.200 --> 01:07.200
In the afternoon our mum makes us do some homework.

01:07.200 --> 01:12.200
Well not homework but more work around the house.

01:12.400 --> 01:18.000
We send our exercise books to our teachers by email on Friday night.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.600
They mark them on Monday and Tuesday and then send them back.

01:22.600 --> 01:25.400
We get them on Wednesday.

01:25.400 --> 01:32.200
The internet and the telephone help us get in touch with our teachers quickly and easily.

01:32.200 --> 01:36.600
We talk to our teachers once a week for about 10 minutes.

01:36.600 --> 01:39.800
They tell us if we are making progress.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.200
Next year I will start at a new school in Port Augusta.

01:44.200 --> 01:48.400
I will spend the weekdays there and come home at weekends.

01:48.400 --> 01:53.800
It will be good to be with teenagers of my age but I will miss my family.

01:53.800 --> 01:56.800
I hope I will be happy there.

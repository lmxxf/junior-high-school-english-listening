00:00.000 --> 00:03.040
Welcome back everyone!

00:03.040 --> 00:06.560
Hi Ling Ling, how was your holiday?

00:06.560 --> 00:08.060
Not bad.

00:08.060 --> 00:12.260
I went to see my grandparents in Henan province.

00:12.260 --> 00:18.660
The train was full of people and I had to stand for over three hours.

00:18.660 --> 00:19.660
Bad luck.

00:19.660 --> 00:23.560
Why is travel so difficult and winter?

00:23.560 --> 00:29.640
Well, it's the busiest season in China because of the Spring Festival.

00:29.640 --> 00:31.960
Where's Tony?

00:31.960 --> 00:35.560
He went to stay with his family in the UK.

00:35.560 --> 00:40.560
He's flying back today, but the flight is late.

00:40.560 --> 00:43.240
Where did you go, darling?

00:43.240 --> 00:50.000
We flew direct to Hong Kong and the plane left a bit late too, but the pilots succeed

00:50.000 --> 00:52.600
in landing on time.

00:52.600 --> 00:57.920
Then we took a boat to Land Tau Island and went to Disneyland.

00:57.920 --> 01:00.080
It was great fun.

01:00.080 --> 01:02.320
How about you, Betty?

01:02.320 --> 01:05.440
We had quite a good time in Beijing.

01:05.440 --> 01:09.640
We toured the city by bus and by taxi.

01:09.640 --> 01:15.960
Last weekend we took a tour by coach to the summer palace and went for a long walk around

01:15.960 --> 01:16.960
the lake.

01:16.960 --> 01:22.560
That sounds great, but now we'd better get back to work.

01:22.560 --> 01:26.440
We're going to have a big exam at the end of the term.

01:26.440 --> 01:31.320
There's nothing to worry about as long as you work hard.

01:31.320 --> 01:36.040
And after the exam, there's the school leave as party.

01:36.040 --> 01:38.600
We're all looking forward to it.

01:38.600 --> 01:39.600
Exactly.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.520
We'll have a great time.

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Lea Lin and Lea Way are on the station platform, saying goodbye to each other.

00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
Tell mum and dad I'll miss them. I'll miss you all.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
And we'll miss you too.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
See you at the spring festival.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
Take care. Bye.

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
Lea Lin gets on the train and looks for his seat.

00:26.000 --> 00:31.000
Excuse me, sir. I'm afraid you're sitting in my seat.

00:31.000 --> 00:38.000
I'm sorry, young man. What did you say? I can't hear very well.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
You've taken the wrong seat.

00:41.000 --> 00:49.000
Really? But I thought it was my seat. Where's my ticket?

00:50.000 --> 00:57.000
The elderly man looks for his ticket in his pocket, his bag and finally in his wallet.

00:57.000 --> 01:04.000
Here it is. Car 9, seat 12A.

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
This is seat 12A, isn't it?

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
The ticket officer arrives.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
Tickets, please. Please have your tickets ready.

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
Excuse me. Is this seat 12A?

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
Yes, it is. Let's have a look at your ticket.

01:25.000 --> 01:36.000
Oh, I see the problem. This is seat 12A, but you should be in car 9. This is car 8.

01:36.000 --> 01:44.000
Oh, how stupid of me. I'd better go and find car 9.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
The elderly man gets up and starts to collect his bags.

01:48.000 --> 01:55.000
Wait a moment, sir. Please stay here. I'll take your seat in car 9.

01:55.000 --> 02:00.000
Well, that's very good of you. Thank you.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
Yes, thank you, young man.

02:04.000 --> 02:11.000
Lee Lin goes past people standing in the train to car 9.

02:11.000 --> 02:20.000
10A, 11A, 12A. Here it is. That's my seat.

02:20.000 --> 02:29.000
His friend, Wang Peng, is sitting in seat 12B. He is surprised to see Lee Lin.

02:29.000 --> 02:36.000
What a surprise. Hey, Wang Peng. It's great to see you.

02:36.000 --> 02:42.000
Great to see you too. Wonderful. I'll have someone to talk to on the long journey.

02:42.000 --> 02:48.000
Now, take off your jacket, sit down and make yourself comfortable.

02:48.000 --> 02:55.000
But why are you so late? Oh, it's a long story.

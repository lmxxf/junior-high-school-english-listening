Good morning. Can you help me with flights to Australia? I'm going to Sydney, and I also

00:07.320 --> 00:15.480
want to visit friends in Hong Kong. A flight to Sydney, Australia, stopping in Hong Kong.

00:15.480 --> 00:22.960
Yes, please. How long is the flight? The flight from London to Hong Kong is 12 hours.

00:22.960 --> 00:30.960
Then from Hong Kong to Sydney, it takes another nine hours. That sounds good. How far is it

00:30.960 --> 00:38.320
from the airport to the centre of Hong Kong? It takes about an hour from the airport.

00:38.320 --> 00:46.560
And how much would that flight cost? From London to Sydney, stopping in Hong Kong.

00:46.560 --> 00:56.320
The flight works out at £1,199. You can book a hotel in Hong Kong with us as well. The flight

00:56.320 --> 01:04.280
and hotel together comes to a total of £1,247.

01:04.280 --> 01:11.200
On the return flight, would I stop in Hong Kong again? Do you want to stop in Hong Kong

01:11.200 --> 01:18.800
on the way back as well? Or do you want to fly direct from Sydney to London? That flight

01:18.800 --> 01:29.760
takes 24 hours, and it costs £1,199. We could also book you into a hotel near the airport

01:29.760 --> 01:39.640
in Sydney. That's £70 more. How far is the airport from the centre of Sydney? About 20

00:00.000 --> 00:08.600
Concorde could carry 100 passengers and flew faster than the speed of sound.

00:08.600 --> 00:15.040
Many people think Concorde was one of the greatest planes, but now Concorde is just part

00:15.040 --> 00:17.760
of history.

00:17.760 --> 00:24.840
For 27 years passengers travelled across the Atlantic Ocean on this plane.

00:24.840 --> 00:32.240
Most of them were business people, film stars, rock stars and sports heroes.

00:32.240 --> 00:39.080
Flying at more than twice the speed of sound Concorde took people from London or Paris to

00:39.080 --> 00:44.080
New York in just over three hours.

00:44.080 --> 00:48.720
The invention of Concorde was a huge step forward.

00:48.720 --> 00:52.120
The plane was like a time machine.

00:52.120 --> 01:03.440
If Concorde left London at 10.30am, it arrived in New York at about 8.30am, 1.30pm London

01:03.440 --> 01:06.280
time, the same day.

01:06.280 --> 01:10.600
However, the plane had many problems.

01:10.600 --> 01:13.320
It was very noisy.

01:13.320 --> 01:19.400
Some believed that its noise was bad for the environment, and that it could hurt people's

01:19.400 --> 01:20.960
ears.

01:20.960 --> 01:30.600
In a terrible accident in 2000 near Paris, 113 people died, and after that fewer people

01:30.600 --> 01:33.680
wanted to fly on Concorde.

01:33.680 --> 01:37.720
It became too expensive to continue the service.

01:37.720 --> 01:43.000
At the end of October 2003, Concorde stopped flying.

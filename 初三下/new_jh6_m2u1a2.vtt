Hi Tony. Hi, darling. It's good to see you again. How was London?

00:07.240 --> 00:12.400
It wasn't bad. The weather was nice. And what did you get up to?

00:12.400 --> 00:21.080
Not much really. I visited a friend. Her name is Susie. I went along to her school, too.

00:21.080 --> 00:29.280
I played football with some of her classmates at lunchtime. You went to school on your holiday.

00:29.280 --> 00:38.280
Tony, let me give you some friendly advice. When you go on holiday, you are supposed to stay away from school.

00:38.280 --> 00:44.280
Ha, well, I didn't go to lessons. I was just visiting.

Hey Tony, did you enjoy yourself in London?

00:04.200 --> 00:10.400
Yes, I went to see my friend Suzy and I visited her school.

00:10.400 --> 00:13.200
What are English schools like?

00:13.200 --> 00:17.200
Here are a few photos. I took them myself.

00:17.200 --> 00:19.200
Let's have a look.

00:19.200 --> 00:22.400
So this is Suzy's school.

00:22.400 --> 00:28.600
It's got about 700 pupils, like most schools in England.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.200
How many pupils are there in a class in England?

00:32.200 --> 00:34.200
About 30.

00:34.200 --> 00:39.800
We have 40 in our class, so ours is a bit bigger.

00:39.800 --> 00:44.600
Look, everyone is wearing a jacket and tie.

00:44.600 --> 00:49.600
Yes, every student wears school clothes in England.

00:49.600 --> 00:53.800
And everyone is sitting around tables in the classroom.

00:53.800 --> 00:57.800
That's right, they don't sit in rows.

00:58.200 --> 01:02.600
Look at the swimming pool and the huge sports ground.

01:02.600 --> 01:06.200
Most English schools have sports grounds.

01:06.200 --> 01:09.800
Kids there really enjoy playing football.

01:09.800 --> 01:12.800
We like playing football too.

01:12.800 --> 01:16.800
And we also have an excellent swimming team.

01:16.800 --> 01:20.200
I hope I can visit Suzy's school one day.

01:20.200 --> 01:22.600
It looks really great.

01:22.600 --> 01:27.800
Our school is great too and we have more students here.

01:27.800 --> 01:31.000
This means more people to play with.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.800
And more friends too.

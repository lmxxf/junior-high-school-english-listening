00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
My school life

00:02.940 --> 00:10.660
My name is Susie Thompson and I'm 15. I've been at River School London since I was 11

00:11.360 --> 00:16.260
If I pass my exams next year, I'll stay here until I'm 18

00:17.540 --> 00:23.300
River School is a secondary school about 20 minutes away from my home by bike

00:24.540 --> 00:28.700
Before I came here, I went to the primary school near my home

00:28.700 --> 00:34.420
I started primary school when I was five and stayed there for six years

00:35.220 --> 00:42.840
We go to school every weekday from 8.45 a.m. to 3.15 p.m

00:43.960 --> 00:48.860
Before class our teacher checks which pupils are present or absent

00:49.140 --> 00:56.160
Then everyone goes to the main hall there our head teacher tells us news about the school

00:56.800 --> 01:04.340
At 905 a.m. the bell rings and lessons start each lesson lasts for an hour

01:04.760 --> 01:10.440
We have a break from 11.05 a.m. until 11.15 a.m

01:10.960 --> 01:14.740
then another lesson and then lunch for an hour

01:15.720 --> 01:20.320
In the afternoon we have two more lessons before school finishes

01:21.220 --> 01:31.580
This year I have ten subjects maths English physics chemistry French history geography

01:32.360 --> 01:35.120
Music IT and P

01:35.960 --> 01:42.600
Some people learn German instead of French. It's lucky. We don't have exams in every subject

01:43.580 --> 01:51.980
We have a large sports ground for football and tennis where we can play both during and after school hours

01:52.720 --> 01:59.740
After school activities such as sports clubs and language societies are popular too

02:00.880 --> 02:10.060
During the school year there are usually visits to museums and to camps for activities such as climbing and walking in the country

02:11.000 --> 02:14.360
Last year a group of us even went to Japan

02:14.880 --> 02:20.500
There are parties and a sports day and school plays are really popular

02:20.980 --> 02:28.080
Once a term there is a parents meeting so our parents and teachers can talk about our progress

02:28.900 --> 02:30.900
What do I like best about school?

02:31.700 --> 02:37.580
English, chemistry, music, sports clubs, school plays and

02:37.580 --> 02:39.860
Above all my friends

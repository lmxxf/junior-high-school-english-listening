Hi, my name is Kate and I am a year nine people here at River School. I'm studying maths,

00:10.660 --> 00:17.920
science and English with everyone else, but I've chosen German this year because I like

00:17.920 --> 00:25.560
learning languages and I want to go on holiday to Germany next year with my family.

00:25.560 --> 00:32.640
I'm a member of the language club. We're learning Chinese and we have a teacher from China

00:32.640 --> 00:40.200
at our school this year. I'm also a member of the tennis team and I practice every Wednesday

00:40.200 --> 00:49.400
afternoon after school. We have matches on Saturday mornings. Last year we were the best

00:49.400 --> 00:54.520
team so this year we must try hard to stay the best.

00:54.520 --> 01:05.120
Hi, I'm Pete. I'm a student here at River School too but I'm in Year 10. This year I'm

01:05.120 --> 01:13.800
taking maths, science and English like everyone else but I've chosen geography as my special

01:13.800 --> 01:21.320
subject because I'm really interested in other places and I want to travel a lot in the future.

01:21.320 --> 01:29.560
I'm a member of the language club so I can learn more languages that will help when I travel.

01:29.560 --> 01:37.560
I'm also a member of the chess club. I've played chess since I was in primary school and I'm

01:37.560 --> 01:46.440
the best player in the school. I plan to win all my chess matches next year. I'm not so good at

01:46.440 --> 01:53.720
sport but I go to football practice on Wednesday afternoons to stay fit and healthy.

1. The school day begins at 9am. Class teachers meet the class and check who is present

00:10.560 --> 00:18.800
or absent at the start of the day. All the classes meet once a week on Fridays. The head

00:18.800 --> 00:28.340
teacher speaks to the whole school. Morning lessons begin at 9.20am. There are three

00:28.340 --> 00:39.580

00:39.580 --> 00:46.500
Afternoon lessons begin at 1pm and the school day finishes at 3pm.

2. All the students study and take exams in maths, science and English. They also choose

00:56.820 --> 01:07.860
one subject from history, geography, art, French and Chinese. All the students take PE lessons,

01:07.860 --> 01:19.780
but no exams are required. 3. The chess, music, language and theatre clubs often have meetings

01:19.780 --> 01:27.700

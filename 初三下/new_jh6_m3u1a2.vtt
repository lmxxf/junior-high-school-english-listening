00:00.000 --> 00:09.840
So, for history homework, I'd like you to write about life in the past and life today.

00:09.840 --> 00:16.720
Please answer the question, is life today better than it was in the past?

00:16.720 --> 00:18.760
Yes, Betty?

00:18.760 --> 00:24.160
Can we write about anything such as medicine and pollution?

00:24.400 --> 00:34.960
Yes, think about how our medical knowledge has grown and of course the environment is an important part of our lives today.

00:34.960 --> 00:37.920
And what about personal safety?

00:37.920 --> 00:43.680
That's a good idea, darling. Do you think we are safer today?

00:43.680 --> 00:51.520
Well, I think there are fewer accidents than in the past. Life is safer certainly.

00:51.520 --> 00:54.640
And why do you think this is true?

00:54.640 --> 00:59.280
Probably because there are so many laws to protect us today.

00:59.280 --> 01:04.240
Okay, you can write about personal safety as well.

01:04.240 --> 01:08.960
Remember to hand in your homework next Monday.

00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
It's getting late, Betty. How is your homework?

00:04.000 --> 00:11.000
Nearly finished. Mom, do you think that life is better today than in the past?

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
Yes. Of course I do. I do too.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
People are well-thier today, and they live longer than they did in the past.

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
That's true. We know more about medicine today, and there's less fear of getting ill

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
because we know how to deal with the ordinary diseases.

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
But people don't take as much exercise as they used to.

00:36.000 --> 00:43.000
I suppose that's because more people have cars, and they walk or use their bikes less.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.000
Some people think life in the past was simpler and healthier than today.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
More wealth sometimes means less health.

00:53.000 --> 01:00.000
When the number of cars is doubled, the pollution is also doubled or even worse.

01:00.000 --> 01:06.000
What about work? Do people work as hard as they did 50 years ago?

01:06.000 --> 01:14.000
Yes, and they sometimes work harder. People seldom say they have enough spare time.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
Why don't you go and ask Mrs. Lee, our neighbor?

01:18.000 --> 01:24.000
She's over 70 years old. She's seen how life has changed.

01:24.000 --> 01:32.000
That's a good idea. I'll go and ask her. Remember to speak up. She's a bit deaf now.

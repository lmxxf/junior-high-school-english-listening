00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Life now and then, by Betty King.

00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
Mrs. Lee is over 70 years old.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
She has lived in Beijing all her life.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
I asked her about life today and in the past.

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
What was your life like in the past?

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
My family lived in a tiny house.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
There were no electric lights, only candles.

00:31.000 --> 00:42.000
My father was a postman and he often worked 12 hours a day outside in the winter cold or in the summer heat.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
My mum was a farm girl before she met my father.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
She was a kind and loving mother.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
She didn't go out to work.

00:52.000 --> 01:00.000
There were five children in my family and looking after us was more than a full-time job.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
I remember the family meals.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
The food was simple.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
We could only eat meat once or twice a year.

01:09.000 --> 01:15.000
I wasn't sent to school because my family couldn't afford it.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
And what's more, because I was a girl.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
How has life changed?

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
Families have got smaller than they were in the past.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
Today, most people only have one child.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
The role of women has changed too.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
My daughter is really lucky.

01:38.000 --> 01:46.000
She has a good education and she goes to work even after getting married.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
I'm happy to see she's busy working every day.

01:50.000 --> 01:57.000
But sometimes I feel lonely because she can't come to see me often.

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
Transport and travel are easier today.

02:01.000 --> 02:08.000
When I was young, I went everywhere on foot or sometimes by bike.

02:08.000 --> 02:15.000
Now you can take the bus everywhere and there's also the underground.

02:15.000 --> 02:21.000
And you young people can take a plane to anywhere in the world.

02:21.000 --> 02:28.000
The only thing I don't like though is that there's so much more traffic.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
It's so difficult to cross the road.

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
Of course, we didn't have television when I was a child.

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
I really enjoy watching television today.

02:40.000 --> 02:47.000
There are so many good programs like the Beijing Opera and old films.

02:47.000 --> 02:52.000
But some of the shows are too noisy for me.

02:52.000 --> 02:57.000
Generally speaking, I think life is better today.

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
We eat better and we live longer.

Dear Christine, you asked me for help about your school project, the lives of children in

00:08.820 --> 00:18.500
Victorian Britain. I was also interested. I searched online and found out the following.

00:18.500 --> 00:26.280
In Victorian Britain thousands of people came to the cities to work in the factories,

00:26.280 --> 00:34.580
instead of the green, open countryside, people lived in very small houses, very close to each

00:34.580 --> 00:44.980
other, with no space for children to play. Families in those days were quite big. Often there were four

00:44.980 --> 00:54.480
or five children in one family, and they all had to sleep in houses of just two rooms. Sometimes

00:54.480 --> 01:04.360
a whole street had to share one outside toilet. Can you imagine that? Most of the big cities were

01:04.360 --> 01:14.120
dirty and unhealthy. The pollution from factories filled the air. People put their rubbish outside

01:14.120 --> 01:23.880
in the streets. As a result there were many illnesses. And life was harder for children in those times,

01:23.880 --> 01:33.080
they didn't always go to school because they had to work instead. Many children started work in

01:33.080 --> 01:42.280
factories when they were only four or five years old. They worked 12 hours a day in dangerous

01:42.280 --> 01:51.680
jobs for very little money. Many were hurt in accidents with machines. I hope this is helpful.

01:51.680 --> 01:57.680
Write to me if you need more information with love.

00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Mom, I'm leaving early tomorrow morning.

00:04.000 --> 00:07.000
It's the trip to the Western Hills.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
Happy you got everything ready?

00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
Yes, I've just put everything in my bag.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
So who's leading the group?

00:15.000 --> 00:21.000
Mr. Jackson, he'll tell us everything about personal safety.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
Do you have to take anything to eat?

00:24.000 --> 00:25.000
Yes, we do.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
Everybody's bringing a picnic lunch.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
You should take plenty of water.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
You mustn't drink the water from a stream.

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
And don't walk too close to the sides of the hill path.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
It's very high in places.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
It's okay, Mom. Relax.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
It's a walking trip.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
There's nothing much to worry about.

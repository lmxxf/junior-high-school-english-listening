00:00.000 --> 00:11.000
Okay, please pay attention for a moment. Before we set off, there are a few rules and suggestions for you.

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
Yes, Mr. Jackson.

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
First, is everyone wearing strong shoes and thick socks?

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
Yes, Mr. Jackson.

00:23.000 --> 00:30.000
Okay, whenever you go walking in the hills, you should always wear proper clothes.

00:30.000 --> 00:39.000
Now, you mustn't walk too close to the edge of the hill path because you might fall and hurt yourselves.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
Is that clear?

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
Yes.

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
And you have to keep together so you don't get lost.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
You mustn't go off on your own.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
No, we won't, Mr. Jackson.

00:54.000 --> 00:59.000
Can we have something to eat now? I'm starving.

00:59.000 --> 01:04.000
No, you can't, Starming. You just had breakfast an hour ago.

01:04.000 --> 01:10.000
Let's start walking and we'll stop at noon for our picnic.

01:10.000 --> 01:17.000
Don't drink all your water in one go. You may need some later.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Can we go rock climbing?

01:19.000 --> 01:25.000
No, you can't. And you must be careful of falling stones.

01:25.000 --> 01:34.000
Okay, off we go down this path and across the stream and then we'll...

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Have lunch!

01:35.000 --> 01:42.000
Have lunch when we get up to the top. Come on, I'll leave the way.

01:42.000 --> 01:48.000
It should be a fairly smooth walk to begin with because it's a straight path.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
But it'll start to get difficult soon.

00:00.000 --> 00:04.760
Watch out! Bears about!

00:04.760 --> 00:11.800
On the first evening, the three of us were tired after walking for about eight hours.

00:11.800 --> 00:14.700
We soon fell asleep.

00:14.700 --> 00:21.560
In the middle of the night I heard a strange noise outside, but when I looked out of the

00:21.560 --> 00:25.000
tent, there was nothing there.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.680
In the morning I got up to make breakfast.

00:28.680 --> 00:31.400
The bag of food was open.

00:31.400 --> 00:35.000
Bears said Joe.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.760
We should hang the food in a tree tonight.

00:38.760 --> 00:44.120
Later that day we stopped in a beautiful field by a stream.

00:44.120 --> 00:47.960
We put up the tent and fell asleep.

00:47.960 --> 00:51.240
During the night the bears came again.

00:51.240 --> 00:55.160
This time they took the food from the tree.

00:55.160 --> 00:57.240
It wasn't high enough.

00:57.240 --> 00:59.240
Bears can climb trees.

00:59.240 --> 01:04.800
They can smell food from a long way away, said Ben.

01:04.800 --> 01:08.520
We must keep the camp clean, I said.

01:08.520 --> 01:11.280
Bears might think our rubbish is food.

01:11.280 --> 01:15.720
Okay, let's tidy up and move on.

01:15.720 --> 01:19.320
And we should make lots of noise too.

01:19.320 --> 01:25.080
If they know where we are, they may not come any closer, said Joe.

01:25.080 --> 01:33.600
But, if you see a bear, said Ben, you mustn't make any sudden moves or make a sound.

01:33.600 --> 01:36.960
And above all, you mustn't run.

01:36.960 --> 01:41.360
No one can run faster in the forest than a bear.

01:41.360 --> 01:46.160
And remember, we don't have a gun to keep us safe.

01:46.160 --> 01:48.840
At night we went to sleep.

01:48.840 --> 01:51.040
Or we tried to.

01:51.040 --> 01:55.760
The next day we stopped at 11 o'clock for a break.

01:55.760 --> 02:00.480
While the others were resting, I went for a walk in the forest.

02:00.480 --> 02:07.440
Suddenly I saw a baby bear playing with some sticks and stones.

02:07.440 --> 02:10.520
He looked so soft and friendly.

02:10.520 --> 02:16.120
And I remember thinking, if I reach out I can just touch him.

02:16.960 --> 02:20.480
There was a loud noise behind me.

02:20.480 --> 02:22.840
I stood very still.

02:22.840 --> 02:25.440
I didn't even turn my head.

02:25.440 --> 02:28.400
There was another loud noise.

02:28.400 --> 02:32.440
The baby bear looked up and ran towards me.

02:32.440 --> 02:37.640
I turned pale and he ran past me into the woods.

02:37.640 --> 02:40.640
I was still for a few minutes.

02:40.640 --> 02:43.600
Then slowly I turned round.

02:43.600 --> 02:49.480
And I saw the baby bear and his huge mother walking away.

02:49.480 --> 02:51.480
I ran back to my friends.

02:51.480 --> 02:54.960
I have never run so fast.

02:54.960 --> 02:59.440
For the next 10 days, every time there was a sudden noise,

02:59.440 --> 03:02.440
my blood went cold.

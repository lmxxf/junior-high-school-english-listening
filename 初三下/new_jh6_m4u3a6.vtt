00:00.000 --> 00:08.160
With his drawing in his hand, twelve-year-old John Wun Pong said that people must wake up to

00:08.160 --> 00:13.880
the fact that pollution is causing damage to the progress we've made.

00:13.880 --> 00:20.240
"'To save water is to save lives,' he said.

00:20.240 --> 00:26.500
His classmate from the same primary school in the hilly countryside of Western China,

00:26.500 --> 00:33.460
eleven-year-old John Wun has painted a big shining light, with the message that people

00:33.460 --> 00:37.460
must not waste electricity.

00:37.460 --> 00:44.060
The students were members of a project to discuss changes in the climate all over the

00:44.060 --> 00:49.380
world, and what we can do about them.

00:49.380 --> 00:55.780
The school suggested that the students should pass on what they have learnt in school

00:55.780 --> 00:58.700
to their parents and neighbours.

00:58.700 --> 01:06.340
"'I told my family why we should turn off the light when we leave a room,' said one

01:06.340 --> 01:07.340
student.

01:07.340 --> 01:13.540
"'China now has many green schools like this one.'

01:13.540 --> 01:21.060
In order to become a green school, a school must include education about the environment

01:21.060 --> 01:24.220
as part of the timetable.

01:24.220 --> 01:31.780
Education is important and can help children and young people change their habits.

01:31.780 --> 01:38.220
At the same time, they can pass on knowledge to their neighbours, said a director of the

01:38.220 --> 01:40.780
Ministry of Environmental Protection.

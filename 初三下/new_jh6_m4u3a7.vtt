Today on Open Country we're talking to Jane King. Jane takes groups of people walking in the countryside.

00:11.000 --> 00:23.000
Jane, lots of people listening are interested in walking in the countryside. What advice can you give them about taking people for a walk?

00:23.000 --> 00:35.000
Well, the first thing you have to do is to plan the walk carefully. You should think about where you are going to walk and whether there are clearly marked paths.

00:35.000 --> 00:47.000
You should only take marked paths. Farmers don't like people walking off paths because they might make the animals afraid or cause other problems.

00:47.000 --> 01:06.000
What about timing your walk? Yes, that's something you must do too. People can't walk a long way without food and water. Make sure you know where you can stop for lunch. Maybe a picnic area or somewhere like that.

01:06.000 --> 01:19.000
It must be somewhere you can stay out of the rain. Don't forget to tell people to bring food for the picnic. Don't walk when it's too hot or in very bad weather.

01:19.000 --> 01:33.000
It's also important that you know where you're going if you're the leader of the group. You mustn't try out a new walk with a group. You have to know every step of the way yourself first.

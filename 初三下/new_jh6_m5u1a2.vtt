00:00.000 --> 00:03.580
Have you ever had an accident, Dad?

00:03.580 --> 00:05.760
Well, yes.

00:05.760 --> 00:11.920
I cut my finger once, and it took about a month for the wound to get better.

00:11.920 --> 00:16.520
Oh, and I fell off my bike once as well.

00:16.520 --> 00:20.760
I was lying on the ground for about ten minutes.

00:20.760 --> 00:26.240
My knee and my shoulder hurt for a long time after that.

00:26.240 --> 00:28.800
Did you have a temperature after that?

00:28.800 --> 00:30.800
No, I didn't.

00:30.800 --> 00:32.160
Why do you ask?

00:32.160 --> 00:40.320
Oh, I'm just reading about personal safety and accidents in the mountains for my school trip.

00:40.320 --> 00:45.920
I should think the only thing you'll get is stomachache because you eat too much.

00:45.920 --> 00:48.120
Dad, that's not true.

00:00.000 --> 00:03.440
I'm tired, Mr. Jackson.

00:03.440 --> 00:05.800
Let's wait for the others.

00:05.800 --> 00:08.560
They'll catch up in a few minutes.

00:08.560 --> 00:10.200
Who's missing?

00:10.200 --> 00:12.720
Tony and Darming.

00:12.720 --> 00:15.680
They're always at the back of the group.

00:15.680 --> 00:20.160
I thought we had an agreement to stay together.

00:20.160 --> 00:23.400
They were walking more slowly than us.

00:23.400 --> 00:25.960
I think it's going to rain.

00:26.440 --> 00:29.400
I'll go back and look for them.

00:29.400 --> 00:31.400
Help!

00:31.400 --> 00:33.080
It's Darming.

00:33.080 --> 00:35.560
He's had an accident.

00:35.560 --> 00:39.880
He fell over when he was running down the steps.

00:39.880 --> 00:43.560
He's hit his head and his leg hurts.

00:43.560 --> 00:46.800
I think he's broken his leg.

00:46.800 --> 00:48.800
When did he fall?

00:48.800 --> 00:51.440
About ten minutes ago.

00:51.440 --> 00:52.440
OK.

00:52.440 --> 00:55.360
Show me where he is.

00:55.360 --> 00:56.960
There he is.

00:56.960 --> 00:58.680
Hey, Darming.

00:58.680 --> 01:00.920
How do you feel?

01:00.920 --> 01:02.640
My leg hurts.

01:02.640 --> 01:05.600
And I can't see very well.

01:05.600 --> 01:07.640
Will I go blind?

01:07.640 --> 01:08.680
No.

01:08.680 --> 01:11.440
You've just hit your head.

01:11.440 --> 01:13.800
You've cut your knee, too.

01:13.800 --> 01:16.320
There's blood on your leg.

01:16.320 --> 01:18.880
Can you move your foot?

01:18.880 --> 01:19.840
Yes.

01:19.840 --> 01:20.840
Ouch.

01:20.840 --> 01:23.680
Oh, but I can't walk.

01:23.680 --> 01:26.320
We'd better get you to hospital.

01:26.320 --> 01:29.200
I'll call for help on my mobile.

01:29.200 --> 01:30.880
Is it serious?

01:30.880 --> 01:32.080
Will I live?

01:32.080 --> 01:34.200
Of course you will.

01:34.200 --> 01:36.840
It's nothing serious.

01:36.840 --> 01:40.960
Tony, tell everyone we have to call off the walk

01:40.960 --> 01:42.480
and go back home.

5 rules for a healthy life

00:04.000 --> 00:11.000
Thanks to better healthcare, most people are living healthier and longer lives.

00:11.000 --> 00:22.000
Someone who is born today can expect to live about 35 years longer than someone who was born in the 19th century.

00:22.000 --> 00:30.000
It is even thought that in the future more and more people will celebrate their 100th birthdays.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
Here are 5 rules for a healthy life.

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
1. Get off the sofa

00:38.000 --> 00:43.000
Sure, it is comfortable to sit on the sofa and watch TV.

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
But doctors say you should get off the sofa.

00:47.000 --> 00:53.000
To keep fit, you have to walk at least 10,000 steps every day.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
In the past, people's jobs required more physical effort.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
They often had to walk for miles every day.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.000
When farmers were working in the fields, they were keeping fit at the same time.

01:07.000 --> 01:14.000
Think about it. Do you get the same amount of exercise today as they did in the past?

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
2. Eat healthy food

01:18.000 --> 01:25.000
It is important to eat food that is fresh and natural, for example, fruit and vegetables.

01:25.000 --> 01:31.000
Fast food is not healthy. You should only have it once in a while.

01:31.000 --> 01:36.000
Eating too much of the wrong food will harm your health.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
3. Rest while you can

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
When we were babies, we slept for much of the night.

01:44.000 --> 01:53.000
Teenagers do not need as much sleep as babies, but it is important for you to get about 8 hours sleep a night.

01:53.000 --> 02:01.000
At weekends, you have got more time, so use it not just for your friends, but for rest too.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
4. Do not worry. Be happy.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.000
Many people believe that happiness is important for our general health.

02:11.000 --> 02:21.000
Sometimes it is not easy to be a teenager because of the difficulties of school, exams or friendships.

02:21.000 --> 02:27.000
If you are worried about something, talk to your parents or your teacher.

02:27.000 --> 02:32.000
5. Say no to smoking

02:32.000 --> 02:38.000
Yes, you knew I was going to say this. It is so important.

02:38.000 --> 02:45.000
Smoking is not cool. It is dangerous. It harms nearly every part of your body.

02:45.000 --> 02:53.000
Think about how your family and friends will feel and think about what it will do to your health.

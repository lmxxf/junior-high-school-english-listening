Mr Maxwell, please.

00:03.080 --> 00:04.880
Hello, Doctor.

00:04.880 --> 00:05.920
How are you?

00:05.920 --> 00:08.400
I'm fine, thank you, Doctor.

00:08.400 --> 00:11.080
But I need your advice.

00:11.080 --> 00:13.440
I want to give up smoking.

00:13.440 --> 00:15.440
That's a good idea.

00:15.440 --> 00:18.880
Smoking is very bad for your health.

00:18.880 --> 00:21.320
How much do you smoke?

00:21.320 --> 00:22.800
Quite a lot.

00:22.800 --> 00:24.080
Hmm.

00:24.080 --> 00:26.560
And when did you start smoking?

00:26.560 --> 00:30.400
I started smoking when I was 19.

00:30.400 --> 00:32.880
That was 25 years ago.

00:32.880 --> 00:34.880
Have you tried to give up?

00:34.880 --> 00:41.320
Yes, I've tried several times, but I always start smoking again.

00:41.320 --> 00:48.360
Now my daughter has asked me to give up, and I want to try again.

00:48.360 --> 00:54.720
She's very worried about my health, and I want to succeed this time.

00:54.720 --> 00:57.000
Well, let's see.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.600
I'll do some tests.

00:59.600 --> 01:01.240
Have you got a cough?

01:01.240 --> 01:04.600
Yes, I have.

01:04.600 --> 01:06.520
And I'm not fit.

01:06.520 --> 01:08.560
I get a lot of colds.

01:08.560 --> 01:13.640
Well, it's a very good idea to stop smoking.

01:13.640 --> 01:16.280
Smoking causes many illnesses.

01:16.280 --> 01:19.480
How can I succeed?

01:19.480 --> 01:23.560
One thing you can do is to join a group.

01:23.560 --> 01:27.240
That often works because you have other people to help you.

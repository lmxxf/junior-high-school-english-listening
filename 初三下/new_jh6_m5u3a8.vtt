Dear Dad, I'm writing this email because I want to ask you to stop smoking and it's too

00:09.680 --> 00:13.800
difficult to talk about it face to face.

00:13.800 --> 00:22.360
I've looked up a lot of information about smoking and I've found out about its dangers.

00:22.360 --> 00:26.880
You already know that smoking is bad for you.

00:26.880 --> 00:32.080
I've found out that it causes many illnesses.

00:32.080 --> 00:39.520
Did you know that thousands of people die from smoking every year in Britain?

00:39.520 --> 00:43.560
I don't want you to be one of them.

00:43.560 --> 00:50.680
When mum asks you to smoke outside, you think she's just being difficult.

00:50.680 --> 00:54.680
Well, I don't think she is.

00:54.680 --> 01:02.880
Not many people like the smell of smoke in their house or on their clothes and mum doesn't

01:02.880 --> 01:04.680
like it either.

01:04.680 --> 01:12.120
What's more, doctors have found that more and more people who don't smoke are falling

01:12.120 --> 01:13.120
ill.

01:13.120 --> 01:21.600
It's caused by secondary smoking, which could make mum and me ill too.

01:21.600 --> 01:28.680
I know that it is very difficult to stop smoking, but you must try.

01:28.680 --> 01:33.360
Please see the doctor and ask him for help.

01:33.360 --> 01:37.480
We will do anything we can to help you.

01:37.480 --> 01:40.120
Please don't smoke.

01:40.120 --> 01:42.000
Your loving daughter, Kate.

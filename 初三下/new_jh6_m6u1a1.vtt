Hello Mrs Jackson here.

00:04.000 --> 00:07.000
Hello Mrs Jackson, it's Betty here.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
I'm sorry to call you at home.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
Can I speak to Mr Jackson please?

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
Hold on please. I'll go and get him.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
Hello Betty, what can I do for you?

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
I'm doing the invitations for the school-ever's party.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
I need to check some information.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
Is it on Saturday?

00:30.000 --> 00:36.000
Yes, it's on Saturday the 30th of May at 5pm.

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
Saturday the 30th of May at 5pm.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
And where will it be held?

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
Oh, in the school hall.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
What about food?

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
Ask everyone to bring a traditional dish,

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
but make sure it's finger food, something easy to eat.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
And darmings looking after the music.

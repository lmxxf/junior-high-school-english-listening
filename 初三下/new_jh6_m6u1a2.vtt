When is the school leave as party? Look at the school calendar! It'll be held on the 30th of May. We're all invited.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
In fact, I was chosen to play the dance music.

00:15.000 --> 00:21.000
And I was asked to bring some balloons and paint some pictures for the party.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
The teachers have asked everyone to prepare a traditional dish from their home country.

00:27.000 --> 00:35.000
Can we cook it at school? We can heat it up in the school kitchen, but it should be cooked at home.

00:35.000 --> 00:42.000
What are you going to make? Heart and sour soup. It's made with chicken and vegetables.

00:42.000 --> 00:52.000
But the invitation says finger food. That means you eat it with your fingers. Not with a knife, fork or spoon.

00:52.000 --> 01:03.000
Oh, soup's no good then. What about you? Cheeseburgers. Cheeseburgers are made with hand burgers and cheese.

01:03.000 --> 01:11.000
And you, darling? Jiaozi, my grandmother makes the best Jiaozi.

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
Is she invited to the school leave as party too?

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
Hmm, I see what you mean. What about you, Tony?

01:21.000 --> 01:28.000
A traditional English pizza with cheese, tomato and ham.

01:28.000 --> 01:35.000
Pizza isn't English, it's Italian. But it's eaten everywhere in England.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
It's becoming popular in China too.

00:00.000 --> 00:04.280
Do as the Romans do.

00:04.280 --> 00:09.600
We often say when in Rome do as the Romans do.

00:09.600 --> 00:14.840
So when you eat western food, do as westerners do.

00:14.840 --> 00:21.400
Here are some things that you may need to know about eating together in the west.

00:21.400 --> 00:28.080
In some western countries lunch is usually eaten at about 1 pm.

00:28.080 --> 00:32.880
Dinner is served around 7 pm or even later.

00:32.880 --> 00:40.280
In Spain it is usual to have lunch at 3 pm and dinner at 10 pm.

00:40.280 --> 00:48.640
At the start of a meal the French say bon appétit and the Italians say one appétito.

00:48.640 --> 00:52.280
But there is nothing similar to say in English.

00:52.280 --> 00:59.280
Enjoy your meal is usually only said by the person who brings the food.

00:59.280 --> 01:03.560
Nives and forks are used for most western food.

01:03.560 --> 01:08.880
The fork is held in your left hand and the knife in your right.

01:08.880 --> 01:14.480
And the food is held with the fork and cut with the knife.

01:14.480 --> 01:17.120
Soup is eaten with a spoon.

01:17.120 --> 01:25.520
However there is some food which you can eat with your fingers such as chicken wings and hamburgers.

01:25.520 --> 01:33.120
During the meal you may be invited to serve yourself, usually the ladies before the gentleman,

01:33.120 --> 01:36.720
by someone who says help yourself.

01:36.720 --> 01:42.720
Or you will be served by someone who asks would you like some.

01:42.720 --> 01:46.120
You can take it and say thank you.

01:46.120 --> 01:52.120
If you are given something you do not like, you can just say for example,

01:52.120 --> 01:57.320
I'm sorry, I don't eat meat or I don't eat fish.

01:57.320 --> 01:59.720
No one will be cross.

01:59.720 --> 02:06.120
If you are offered more food but cannot eat anymore, just say no thanks.

02:06.120 --> 02:09.720
It was delicious but I've had enough.

02:09.720 --> 02:15.720
Remember that it is polite to say that you enjoy every dish when it is served.

02:15.720 --> 02:20.920
And that you have enjoyed the food at the end of a meal.

02:20.920 --> 02:25.120
It is sometimes difficult to know when the meal is over.

02:25.120 --> 02:33.320
If you are invited to dinner by western friends, you will be expected to stay and talk around the dinner table

02:33.320 --> 02:36.520
long after the last dish is served.

02:36.520 --> 02:41.320
And it is not polite if you leave as soon as you finish eating.

02:41.320 --> 02:46.120
The rule is watch the other people do as they do.

1. During my visit to Britain, I was taken to a restaurant by a British family. I put

00:09.160 --> 00:16.320
my knife and fork down while I was telling them a story. A waiter came and took my plate

00:16.320 --> 00:23.680
away. I found out later that putting your knife and fork down in the middle of the plate

00:23.680 --> 00:35.880
means I finished. 2. I visited my company's French office and I was taken out for dinner.

00:35.880 --> 00:43.600
Soon after we sat down, a waiter came with some small dishes of food. I offered them to

00:43.600 --> 00:50.840
everyone at the table. Then one of the French people said to me, do you realise that's

00:50.840 --> 00:59.480
my food you're offering everyone? 3. I was asked to dinner by some Chinese people

00:59.480 --> 01:06.640
I did business with. I was given some delicious food to start with and after that, a bowl

01:06.640 --> 01:13.960
of water was put in front of me with lemon in it. I picked up the spoon and began to drink

01:13.960 --> 01:23.920
it. I felt so stupid when I saw everyone trying not to laugh. It wasn't soup. I was drinking

01:23.920 --> 01:26.280
the water in my finger bowl.

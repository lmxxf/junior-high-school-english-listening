Dear Richard, I'm so glad you're coming to China. Your mother tells me you're worried

00:07.800 --> 00:16.040
about what you should and shouldn't do as a guest in China. Here's some advice. You

00:16.040 --> 00:23.200
will probably be invited to a dinner. There will be a lot of different dishes, not just

00:23.200 --> 00:32.120
three courses. You may find it difficult to use chopsticks if you haven't tried before.

00:32.120 --> 00:40.440
It's a good idea to get some practice beforehand. When the food is served, you should wait until

00:40.440 --> 00:47.960
you're invited to eat. The plates will be placed in the middle of the table for everyone

00:47.960 --> 00:54.440
to share. Take a little of everything and then have some more of the things you like.

00:54.440 --> 01:04.080
Preparation of a big meal takes a long time and everything will look beautiful, so it's a good

01:04.080 --> 01:11.720
topic of conversation. You'd better join in the conversation and say how much you like it.

01:11.720 --> 01:19.640
At the end of the meal, you will usually be served with fruit. I hope this is helpful.

01:19.640 --> 01:25.960
Email me if you have any other questions. Yours Jean-Douy.

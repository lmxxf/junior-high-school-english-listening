Have you made much progress with your Chinese dad?

00:04.480 --> 00:12.280
Yes, I have. I've practised it every day. My level is better than it was last year, even

00:12.280 --> 00:18.520
though I haven't been to classes. But my handwriting still isn't very good. I've

00:18.520 --> 00:24.680
still got some work to do on that, and I still find reading Chinese quite difficult.

00:25.000 --> 00:30.520
Do you think you have to be really smart to be good at a foreign language?

00:30.520 --> 00:37.960
No, I don't. Whatever you do, you have to make an effort. I think Chinese is simpler

00:37.960 --> 00:43.480
than English anyway. I wish I spoke Chinese as well as you do.

00:43.480 --> 00:48.520
I think your Chinese is quite good already. I'm really proud of you.

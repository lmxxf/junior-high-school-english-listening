How much progress do you think you've made in English this year, Lingling?

00:05.400 --> 00:08.000
I think I've achieved a lot.

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
I hope my English is good enough for the exams anyway.

00:12.000 --> 00:19.400
It's also the subject that I'm best at, although my spoken English is not that good.

00:19.400 --> 00:23.560
I can see you really enjoy learning English.

00:23.560 --> 00:29.040
Some people think English is too difficult, and it requires too much effort to learn

00:29.040 --> 00:30.840
it well.

00:30.840 --> 00:37.240
English is difficult to learn at the beginning, but if you keep trying, you can make progress

00:37.240 --> 00:41.520
quickly and find a lot of fun in learning it.

00:41.520 --> 00:45.720
I hope I can continue to make progress next year.

00:45.720 --> 00:48.760
I think you've done really well.

00:48.760 --> 00:51.440
Have you ever been to an English corner?

00:51.440 --> 00:57.040
You mean those clubs where people go to practice their English?

00:57.040 --> 01:01.360
I always thought they were for people who speak good English already.

01:01.360 --> 01:07.720
Well, I went to an English corner once, and there were some people who didn't speak

01:07.720 --> 01:14.920
English very well, but they were happy to try, and other people, including some English

01:14.920 --> 01:20.080
speakers from the UK and the US, were happy to talk to them.

01:20.080 --> 01:23.240
I don't have to go to an English corner.

01:23.240 --> 01:26.600
I can speak English with you whenever we meet.

01:26.600 --> 01:31.280
Yes, I'm always happy to speak to you in English.

01:31.280 --> 01:36.680
At the same time, you can also help me with my Chinese.

01:36.680 --> 01:40.680
I think Chinese will be more and more popular in the future.

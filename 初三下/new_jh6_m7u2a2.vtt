00:00.000 --> 00:03.520
Who owned English?

00:03.520 --> 00:09.640
One English is spoken by about 400 million people.

00:09.640 --> 00:16.920
Mostly in the US, the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.

00:16.920 --> 00:23.760
In Ghana, India and Singapore, English is used as a working language, for example between

00:23.760 --> 00:28.640
bosses and secretaries and between doctors and patients.

00:28.640 --> 00:32.960
Although there are other languages for everyday use.

00:32.960 --> 00:38.800
In China and many other countries, English is the most important foreign language that

00:38.800 --> 00:41.120
children learn at school.

00:41.120 --> 00:45.800
Because when they grow up, it will be quite possible for them to meet people from other

00:45.800 --> 00:47.560
countries.

00:47.560 --> 00:52.920
They will need a common language to communicate with each other.

00:52.920 --> 00:57.360
It is now used by nearly a quarter of the world's population.

00:57.360 --> 01:02.560
And anywhere you go in the world, there is a good chance that you will meet someone who

01:02.560 --> 01:04.280
speaks English.

01:04.280 --> 01:06.920
Two.

01:06.920 --> 01:13.000
The reason why English is spoken everywhere is that in the 19th century, English became

01:13.000 --> 01:15.800
the language of world trade.

01:15.800 --> 01:22.400
And in the 20th century, the US spread English to the world through newspapers, television

01:22.400 --> 01:24.160
and films.

01:24.160 --> 01:31.760
It is now the common language for international travel, science, industry and recently information

01:31.760 --> 01:34.400
technology and the internet.

01:34.400 --> 01:37.280
Three.

01:37.280 --> 01:43.560
It is also important to know that English has borrowed many words from other languages.

01:43.560 --> 01:52.280
For example, restaurant from French, zero from Arabic, piano from Italian and tofu from

01:52.280 --> 01:53.280
Chinese.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.880
Four.

01:55.880 --> 01:58.920
Will the importance of English last?

01:58.920 --> 02:05.880
As China continues to grow, many people think that Chinese will become as common as English

02:05.880 --> 02:09.320
by the middle of the 21st century.

02:09.320 --> 02:15.200
More and more schools in Europe are teaching Chinese as a foreign language, together with

02:15.200 --> 02:17.360
some European languages.

02:17.360 --> 02:24.360
However, most people still think that English will be used most around the world, at least

02:24.360 --> 02:27.360
for the next 20 or 30 years.

02:27.360 --> 02:29.360
Five.

02:29.360 --> 02:31.600
So who owns English?

02:31.600 --> 02:35.200
The answer is everyone who speaks it.

02:35.200 --> 02:42.440
The British, the Indians and the Chinese all help make it a rich language.

02:42.440 --> 02:49.240
Even though we speak different types of English, we are all part of an international club.

02:49.240 --> 02:50.840
We all own English.

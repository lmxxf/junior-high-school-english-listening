English was once spoken only by people in a part of Britain. But during the 20th century,

00:08.960 --> 00:15.680
it became a world language. A language used by speakers of many different languages to

00:15.680 --> 00:22.240
communicate with each other. Although it is called a world language, more than five

00:22.240 --> 00:29.200
billion people, most of the people on the earth, do not speak English as either their first

00:29.200 --> 00:36.880
or second language. However, hundreds of millions of people use it and hundreds of millions

00:36.880 --> 00:45.040
are learning it. Because so many people learn and use English, it may be hard to imagine

00:45.040 --> 00:52.320
that one day English may not be the world's leading language. Remember that there were other

00:52.320 --> 00:57.360
important languages in the past which lost their importance or even disappeared.

00:57.520 --> 01:05.280
In Europe, Latin was used as a common language for many centuries before people stopped using it.

01:06.240 --> 01:12.560
French was once a language known by all well-educated people and was more popular than English.

01:13.200 --> 01:17.600
But since the 19th century, English has become more popular than French.

01:18.960 --> 01:26.480
Today, many people who want to learn a new language are learning Chinese, Spanish, or Arabic.

01:27.360 --> 01:40.720
It may be that one day, instead of English, another language will be used across the world.

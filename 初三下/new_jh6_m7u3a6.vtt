00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Now talk.

00:03.000 --> 00:11.680
It's easy to find books, CDs and online courses to practice English, but I want to talk

00:11.680 --> 00:14.160
to a native English speaker.

00:14.160 --> 00:19.000
I went to England and I got lots of practice talking to people.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.920
Then I came home.

00:20.920 --> 00:27.840
I quickly lost my new skills because I didn't have anyone to talk to.

00:27.840 --> 00:30.400
I speak English every week.

00:30.400 --> 00:32.600
I use now talk.

00:32.600 --> 00:37.840
It's a website that helps you use and remember your spoken English.

00:37.840 --> 00:41.680
This is how now talk works.

00:41.680 --> 00:48.400
We meet on the internet and have an English conversation which lasts for one hour, once

00:48.400 --> 00:51.160
a week, for four weeks.

00:51.160 --> 00:56.960
Although it's not a private course, we get a lot of speaking practice because there are

00:56.960 --> 01:00.800
only four students for one teacher.

01:00.800 --> 01:01.800
We use Skype.

01:01.800 --> 01:08.960
It's an internet programme you can use to talk to anyone in the world.

01:08.960 --> 01:12.120
Call now talk for more information.

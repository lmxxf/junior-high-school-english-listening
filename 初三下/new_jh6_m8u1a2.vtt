00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Excuse me.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
Betty.

00:04.000 --> 00:07.000
Sorry, I can't hear you.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
What did you say?

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
Can you turn the music down?

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
Oh, come on, Mom.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
I was dancing.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
It's got a great beat.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
But it's okay.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
I'm going out now.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
It's the school lever's party tonight.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
Why are you going so early?

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
The party doesn't start until five o'clock.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
I'm going to help Tony put up pictures and balloons in the hall.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
And hang flags from all over the world.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
Do you need something to eat before you go to the party?

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
No thanks, Mom.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
There'll be plenty to eat.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
We're all going to take our food to the party and share it.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
Don't forget to take your food with you.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
It's on the table.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
Okay, bye.

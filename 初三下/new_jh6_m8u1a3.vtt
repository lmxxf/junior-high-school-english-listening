00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
You look lovely, Ling Ling.

00:03.000 --> 00:06.000
Thanks. You look great too.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
That's a nice handbag.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
It's my mother's.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
Are you enjoying the party?

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
Yes, I am.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
But I feel a bit sad.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
I don't know when we'll be back in this hall together again.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
I'm going to miss you all.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
Yes, we'll all miss each other.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
Hey, Tony.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
You hung international flags on the walls.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
They make the hall wonderful.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
They look okay, don't they?

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
Listen to the music.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
It's got a great beat.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
Pardon?

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
Oh, yes. But it's a bit noisy.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
Do you intend to stay in China for long, Tony?

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
I hope so.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
And even if I go back to the UK,

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
I'll come back and visit you all.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
What about you, Betty?

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
I'll finish my high school education here,

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
but I want to go back to my hometown one day.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
What are your plans, darling?

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
I want to become an English teacher.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Good for you.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
Come on, let's fetch something to eat.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
What's on the menu?

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
How about a hot dog?

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Or some pancakes?

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
And we've got some apple juice.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
Let's raise our glasses.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
Here's to our friendship, everyone.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
And to the future.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Cheers!

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
And now, excuse me, I must make a speech.

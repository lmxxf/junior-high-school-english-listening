00:00.000 --> 00:11.400
Dear Headteacher, teachers, parents and fellow students, and very proud that you have chosen

00:11.400 --> 00:14.400
me to speak to you today.

00:14.400 --> 00:21.760
I have three roses here, a red one, a yellow one, and a white one.

00:21.760 --> 00:28.040
These roses are to thank three groups of people for the three most important things that

00:28.040 --> 00:29.960
I have learnt.

00:29.960 --> 00:35.960
These three things are friendship, effort and trust.

00:35.960 --> 00:39.480
I give the red rose to my friends.

00:39.480 --> 00:46.620
When I started school here, my Chinese was not good, and some of my mistakes were very

00:46.620 --> 00:48.220
funny.

00:48.220 --> 00:56.200
I once tried to say Cie-Cie, but I said Cie-Cie instead.

00:56.200 --> 01:03.600
Of course some people laughed, and I felt quite silly, but they were not laughing at me.

01:03.600 --> 01:10.400
They taught me to say many things in Chinese, and kindly invited me to join them.

01:10.400 --> 01:19.000
Today, thanks to their kindness, my Chinese is much better, and we have become friends.

01:19.000 --> 01:25.960
So let me say Cie-Cie again to all of you for your help.

01:25.960 --> 01:32.020
I give the white rose to my teachers, who have taught me that there is no success without

01:32.020 --> 01:33.820
effort.

01:33.820 --> 01:40.580
When I started running in the 800 meters, I always finished last, and I just wanted to

01:40.580 --> 01:42.500
give up.

01:42.500 --> 01:47.740
But the PE teacher, Ms. Huang, helped me.

01:47.740 --> 01:54.960
She ran along with me, and she said, you only really lose if you give up.

01:54.960 --> 02:02.440
I still can't run fast enough, but I've learned to try my best, not only with running,

02:02.440 --> 02:06.240
but with whatever else I do.

02:06.240 --> 02:13.520
I give the yellow rose to my parents, for teaching me that love is about trust.

02:13.520 --> 02:20.540
When I wanted to learn the violin, my father told me that I should work harder at maths.

02:20.540 --> 02:22.440
I was disappointed.

02:22.960 --> 02:31.400
Then, on the morning of my birthday, I woke up to find a beautiful violin at my bedside.

02:31.400 --> 02:37.200
There was a note from my father, I'm sure you will be good at music.

02:37.200 --> 02:41.520
I know that you will be better at maths.

02:41.520 --> 02:47.680
I'm sure that you all have your own memories about the happiness of the last three years,

02:47.680 --> 02:50.840
and the people whom you want to thank for it.

02:50.840 --> 02:58.240
So let's all stand up and say, thank you, friends, teachers, and parents.

02:58.240 --> 02:59.600
We love you!

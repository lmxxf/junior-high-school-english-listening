Adam is in the studio with us and he's going to tell us about his year between the end

00:06.620 --> 00:09.960
of school and the start of university.

00:09.960 --> 00:15.100
Adam, tell us where you went and what you did there.

00:15.100 --> 00:18.200
I went to Ghana in Africa.

00:18.200 --> 00:23.800
Our main project was building a primary school because there wasn't a school in the village

00:23.800 --> 00:27.260
and the children were studying outside.

00:27.260 --> 00:30.460
Was the experience everything you expected?

00:30.460 --> 00:34.580
Yes, in fact, it was more than I expected.

00:34.580 --> 00:38.400
I felt very proud to be part of the project.

00:38.400 --> 00:42.080
We were helping children to have a good education.

00:42.080 --> 00:45.460
What was your favourite thing about Ghana?

00:45.460 --> 00:48.340
The people are very friendly.

00:48.340 --> 00:51.420
My friendship with some of them will last forever.

00:51.420 --> 00:53.140
I'm sure of that.

00:53.140 --> 00:55.780
How did you spend your free time?

00:55.780 --> 00:59.020
That weekend we visited the beaches.

00:59.020 --> 01:05.320
The beaches were lovely and most of the time empty too, very relaxing.

01:05.320 --> 01:08.900
What did you miss most while you were away?

01:08.900 --> 01:12.740
I missed my friends and family most.

01:12.740 --> 01:17.560
Have you found what you want to do with the rest of your life?

01:17.560 --> 01:23.380
The answer is no, but I have discovered what I don't want to do.

01:23.380 --> 01:26.460
I thought I wanted to be an actor.

01:26.460 --> 01:29.820
Now I know that I want to help people.

01:29.820 --> 01:35.380
I've decided to go to college and maybe become a teacher in the future.

01:35.380 --> 01:40.100
So your experience really did change your life?

01:40.100 --> 01:41.220
Yes, it did.

Mark Smith is a student at a vocational school, a school where people learn how to do many

00:07.840 --> 00:12.560
of the jobs that are needed in modern society.

00:12.560 --> 00:18.440
After I finished secondary school, my results showed that I was better at doing things than

00:18.440 --> 00:20.560
at reading books.

00:20.560 --> 00:25.000
I had to decide how I wanted to make a living in the future.

00:25.000 --> 00:32.320
I'm the sort of person who is good at making things with my hands, so I chose to go to vocational

00:32.320 --> 00:33.320
school.

00:33.320 --> 00:38.400
Now, he learns how to repair machines.

00:38.400 --> 00:43.600
Everyone needs a skill that is useful if they want a good life, and I like learning

00:43.600 --> 00:47.520
about how things work, he says.

00:47.520 --> 00:51.720
Mark tells people that he is very happy about his choice.

00:52.280 --> 00:56.240
Now I can study the things that I like best.

00:56.240 --> 01:00.240
Everyone wants to study what they are good at, don't they?

01:00.240 --> 01:04.600
He believes that he has a bright future ahead of him.

01:04.600 --> 01:09.160
You can't have a society where everyone works in an office.

01:09.160 --> 01:14.560
Workers who can make things and repair things will always be needed.

01:14.560 --> 01:19.560
When people ask Mark what he is most interested in, he smiles.

01:19.560 --> 01:20.560
Plains.

01:20.760 --> 01:25.880
I don't know why I've always loved machines that fly, but I do.

01:25.880 --> 01:31.400
One day, I'm going to help repair the planes that carry people all over the world.

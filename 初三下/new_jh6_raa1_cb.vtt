Conversation B.

00:03.500 --> 00:05.000
Hello Betty.

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
Hi Tony.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
You don't look very well. What's wrong with you?

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
I've got a toothache and a bad cough.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
You must have caught a cold. Have you seen a doctor?

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
Yes, he took my temperature. It seemed alright.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
What did the doctor say then?

00:26.000 --> 00:31.000
Oh, he said it was nothing serious. Just a bad cold.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
He gave me some medicine and told me to take it three times a day.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
Don't worry.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
You'd better drink lots of water and get plenty of sleep.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
That's the best medicine for a cold.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
I will. Thank you.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
Hope you get well soon.

conversation E. Would you like to see a film with me tonight, David?

00:07.000 --> 00:15.000
Go to the cinema. Are you crazy? We've got an exam tomorrow. Aren't you going to go over the lessons?

00:15.000 --> 00:24.000
I go over my lessons every day. I'm not worried. I'd like to do something relaxing before the exam.

00:24.000 --> 00:31.000
You always work so hard, Kate. No wonder you never worry about exams.

00:31.000 --> 00:39.000
You seem to do well in every subject. English, Chinese, history, physics.

00:39.000 --> 00:45.000
Except maths. But it's no use working out maths problems before an exam.

00:45.000 --> 00:52.000
You're right. But I'd better study tonight or I'll fail the exam.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
Okay. Try to go to bed early and good luck.

00:56.000 --> 01:03.000
Thanks. I hope next time I can see a film with you. Have a good time.

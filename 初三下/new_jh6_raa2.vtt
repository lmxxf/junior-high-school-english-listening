00:00.000 --> 00:06.800
Look Dad, the music kids are going to play at the Sports Centre next month.

00:06.800 --> 00:09.040
They're a fantastic group.

00:09.040 --> 00:11.440
We must try to get tickets.

00:11.440 --> 00:13.360
Where can we buy tickets?

00:13.360 --> 00:19.080
At the Sports Centre from 9 o'clock on Saturday morning.

00:19.080 --> 00:21.160
That'll be difficult Tony.

00:21.160 --> 00:26.120
We'll have to get there early and stand in line for a long time.

00:26.120 --> 00:29.200
We can also buy tickets online.

00:29.200 --> 00:31.120
There's a website address.

00:31.120 --> 00:33.320
Okay, let's try it.

00:33.320 --> 00:37.440
Look, they're on sale already.

00:37.440 --> 00:39.240
Here we are.

00:39.240 --> 00:42.360
Now how many tickets do you want?

00:42.360 --> 00:44.360
Let's get four.

00:44.360 --> 00:48.680
For a dumbing, Ling Ling, Betty and me.

00:48.680 --> 00:49.680
Okay.

00:49.680 --> 00:52.760
Oh no, we can only buy two.

00:52.760 --> 00:56.680
They won't sell more than two tickets at a time.

00:56.680 --> 01:01.320
Well, let's forget about Ling Ling and Betty then.

01:01.320 --> 01:05.400
I don't think they really like the band anyway.

01:05.400 --> 01:10.480
Let's get two tickets, one for dumbing and one for me.

01:10.480 --> 01:14.840
They're playing on Wednesday and Thursday.

01:14.840 --> 01:17.840
I'd like to go on Wednesday.

01:17.840 --> 01:19.600
What time does it start?

01:19.600 --> 01:21.480
Let me see.

01:21.480 --> 01:25.120
Oh yes, it starts at seven o'clock.

01:25.120 --> 01:27.920
What time does it finish?

01:27.920 --> 01:29.600
At eleven o'clock.

01:29.600 --> 01:30.600
It's late.

01:30.600 --> 01:33.080
I'll meet you outside.

01:33.080 --> 01:34.080
Great.

01:34.080 --> 01:35.080
How much?

01:35.080 --> 01:38.320
They're three hundred you won each.

01:38.320 --> 01:39.240
Thanks Dad.

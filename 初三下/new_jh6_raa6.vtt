00:00.000 --> 00:05.680
British eating habits are different from those in China.

00:05.680 --> 00:11.600
People in the UK do not usually have rice or noodles for breakfast.

00:11.600 --> 00:14.520
They eat bread instead.

00:14.520 --> 00:20.960
Hot tea, coffee and milk are their usual breakfast drinks.

00:20.960 --> 00:26.920
Lunch is taken later in the UK at about 1 pm.

00:26.920 --> 00:34.920
Some Chinese people like a hot, filling lunch, many British people today may just have a sandwich,

00:34.920 --> 00:39.240
especially if they work in a busy city like London.

00:39.240 --> 00:43.720
There are also differences in the way school children eat lunch.

00:43.720 --> 00:51.000
In the past, British children at hot lunches at school, as most children in China do now,

00:51.000 --> 00:53.640
although the food was different.

00:53.720 --> 00:59.960
Today it is more common for British school children to bring their own lunches to school.

00:59.960 --> 01:07.480
They will usually eat a sandwich and a piece of fruit, and drink, fruit juice or other soft drinks.

01:07.480 --> 01:15.880
Some children like to buy food from shops outside school, but often this is not allowed.

01:15.880 --> 01:21.160
The evening meal is the most important meal in both countries.

01:21.240 --> 01:28.440
In China, people have dinner at about 6 pm, and so do many people in the UK.

01:28.440 --> 01:37.000
In most families in the UK, there is meat with two or three vegetables, and then something sweet.

01:37.000 --> 01:43.880
But in China, people often have more dishes, and usually with some soup.

01:43.880 --> 01:50.280
And of course, in both countries, people look forward to their most important festivals.

01:50.280 --> 01:54.920
Christmas in the UK, and the Spring Festival in China.

01:54.920 --> 02:03.800
Although the food they eat then is different, there is one thing that people in the UK and China share.

02:03.800 --> 02:09.000
The happiness of being with their families and loved ones.

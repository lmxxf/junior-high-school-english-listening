00:00.000 --> 00:06.720
Sometimes, we feel lonely, even though there are lots of people around.

00:06.720 --> 00:13.560
We spoke to some young people about being lonely to find out what we can do about it.

00:13.560 --> 00:22.760
Rosie left the primary school near her home to live at a high school two hours away by bus.

00:22.760 --> 00:26.840
It was the first time she had stayed away from her family.

00:26.840 --> 00:32.680
She did not know anyone at her new school and she was very lonely.

00:32.680 --> 00:38.720
We asked her about it and she told us why she felt so lonely.

00:38.720 --> 00:46.200
I was the only person from my village at my new school and I didn't know anyone at all.

00:46.200 --> 00:49.960
She explained to us what she did about it.

00:49.960 --> 00:57.000
I decided to join some students' clubs and take part in as many activities as I could.

00:57.000 --> 01:02.760
I introduced myself to the other students and tried not to worry.

01:02.760 --> 01:11.200
Slowly, I made friends and now I'm so busy that I'm almost never lonely.

01:11.200 --> 01:14.040
Next, we spoke to John.

01:14.040 --> 01:21.360
Last year, his family moved to a new city and he started at a new school.

01:21.360 --> 01:27.680
He told us what he did to become part of the new school by being patient when he started

01:27.680 --> 01:30.280
to worry or feel sad.

01:30.280 --> 01:35.080
It takes time to make new friends, he said.

01:35.080 --> 01:43.800
At first, it's a bit difficult to trust new people, but after a while it gets easier.

01:43.800 --> 01:49.600
As these young people found out, there are things you can do to help yourself when you

01:49.600 --> 01:51.560
feel lonely.

01:51.560 --> 01:58.920
You can change your way of thinking and you can also change what you do to help yourself.

conversation B. What makes you proud of your country?

00:06.500 --> 00:15.760
Let me see. That's quite a difficult question. Everything. But above all, I like the countryside

00:15.760 --> 00:21.460
with its fields and hills. What about the cities? Are there any interesting

00:21.460 --> 00:27.880
things for tourists to do? Yes, there are. There are lots of museums,

00:27.880 --> 00:34.640
cinemas and theatres. You can see all the latest films and plays and of course

00:34.640 --> 00:42.400
there are some great concerts. Can you suggest a good time to visit? Well, I think

00:42.400 --> 00:48.400
from April to about November are the best months. Although you always need to be

00:48.400 --> 00:55.920
prepared for rain, it rains a lot in spring and it rains in summer too. But you know,

00:55.920 --> 01:01.160
no one comes to my country for the weather.

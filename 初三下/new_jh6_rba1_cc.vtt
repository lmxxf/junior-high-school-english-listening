Conversation C

00:03.000 --> 00:04.000
Hi Sally.

00:04.000 --> 00:05.000
Hello Ben.

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
Oh yes that's right.

00:07.000 --> 00:11.000
You British people say hello, not hi.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
I forgot that.

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
In fact, lots of British people say hi these days.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
It's all the American TV we watch.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
I don't think people in America say hello much, do they?

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
No, most people just say hi.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
As hello doesn't sound very cool.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.000
Well, let's be British and say hello to each other for a change.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
Okay Sally.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
Oh look, here comes Mike.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
He's from Australia.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
I wonder whether he says hello or hi.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
Hi Mike.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
Hello Mike.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Good day you too.

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
Oh no, he speaks Australian English.

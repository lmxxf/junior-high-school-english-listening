conversation D. Now the school nurse is going to give some advice on how to stay healthy.

00:08.560 --> 00:16.920
Good morning. I'm Jane Wang, the school nurse and I'd just like to say a few words about

00:16.920 --> 00:25.320
keeping fit and healthy eating. Before school, during the breaks and at lunch time, you'd

00:25.320 --> 00:32.960
better go outside and take some exercise in the school field, play football or basketball

00:32.960 --> 00:39.800
or try running. Anything you like, just to get you out of the classroom and move outside

00:39.800 --> 00:47.840
in the fresh air. The school doesn't allow students to eat fast food. Fast food is very

00:47.840 --> 00:56.480
unhealthy. At the school dining hall, you can get some healthy food. Breakfast is served

00:56.480 --> 01:08.040
from 8 to 8.30. During the break from 10.30 to 10.50, you can get some fruit or a drink.

01:08.040 --> 01:16.080
Lunch time is at 1 o'clock and there are plenty of healthy choices like soup, vegetables,

01:16.080 --> 01:23.600
fish and chicken. All the food is both delicious and healthy. I can promise you.

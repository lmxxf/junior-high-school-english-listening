conversation E. Right, we have to talk about the menu for the end of turn party. Have

00:08.520 --> 00:15.080
you got any suggestions? Well, I think since there are going to be about

00:15.080 --> 00:22.400
a hundred people there, it's going to be much easier if we just serve finger food.

00:22.400 --> 00:27.680
What do you mean, sandwiches? That doesn't seem much for a party.

00:27.680 --> 00:35.440
No, we can serve much more than sandwiches. Things like meat, cheese, pieces of fruit,

00:35.440 --> 00:42.760
even chicken wings. I know. Why don't we cook outside? It's probably going to be a

00:42.760 --> 00:50.560
fine evening, so it'll be nice to be cooking and eating outside. Yes, let's cook

00:50.560 --> 00:57.320
chicken legs and wings and sausages. Good idea. And we can serve those with

00:57.320 --> 01:04.160
hot potatoes and salad. But you can't eat hot potatoes or salad with your hands.

01:04.160 --> 01:11.800
No, we'll need knives and forks. Right, so we're not just having finger food then.

01:11.800 --> 01:19.040
No, I really think it would be better to let people use knives and forks and have more food.

01:19.040 --> 01:26.960
Okay, that's decided then. Now, let's discuss the music. We could invite the

01:26.960 --> 01:34.000
school pop group to play. Yes, that would be great. They're very popular. Their

01:34.000 --> 01:38.600
music will be good for a party. We need music with a good beat.

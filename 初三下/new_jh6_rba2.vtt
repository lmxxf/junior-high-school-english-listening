Well, as you can see, the school is very large. We have about 1,200 students here. These

00:10.240 --> 00:18.200
classrooms on the ground floor are where we study French, English and Spanish. And opposite,

00:18.200 --> 00:25.600
this large room is the hall. The whole school meets in there every week. We also put on plays

00:25.600 --> 00:33.320
and concerts in the hall. Let's go upstairs and I'll show you the classrooms there. The three

00:33.320 --> 00:41.960
classrooms on the left are for art. Year 8 are building these models here and look at these

00:41.960 --> 00:50.120
drawings. Year 9 are making them for our new sports centre. Follow me through this door here.

00:50.680 --> 00:57.800
Next to these classrooms we've got the Health Education Room. This is where we learn about

00:57.800 --> 01:06.040
things like the risks of smoking and the importance of keeping healthy and fit. Now, the second floor

01:06.040 --> 01:13.000
is where we do IT. We are really lucky at this school because we've got lots of computers,

01:13.000 --> 01:18.920
printers and CD-ROMs and there are more IT rooms on the top floor.

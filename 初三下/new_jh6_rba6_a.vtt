A. Some unusual jobs.

00:06.160 --> 00:12.160
When we ask students what they would like to be in the future, they often talk about

00:12.160 --> 00:15.960
ordinary jobs like doctors or teachers.

00:15.960 --> 00:22.640
But if you think about it, you will find that many people do not do the jobs they plan

00:22.640 --> 00:27.680
to do. They just start doing their jobs by accident.

00:27.680 --> 00:31.480
We have talked to two people with unusual jobs.

00:31.480 --> 00:36.080
Linda is a dentist, but she does not work with people.

00:36.080 --> 00:38.720
She works with horses.

00:38.720 --> 00:43.920
After university, she took care of animals' health for several years.

00:43.920 --> 00:49.240
She noticed that there were few people who could help with horses' teeth.

00:49.240 --> 00:53.920
So she went back to college and studied again.

00:53.920 --> 00:57.400
Then she had to buy special tools for her work.

00:57.400 --> 01:01.520
She is always very busy taking care of horses' teeth.

01:01.520 --> 01:06.720
I really enjoy working with horses, said Linda.

01:06.720 --> 01:11.960
As soon as Mike could read, he read books about robots.

01:11.960 --> 01:17.200
When he was older, he decided to make building robots his job.

01:17.200 --> 01:23.880
He made up his mind to study science, maths and computers so that he could break into the

01:23.880 --> 01:27.240
world of robot engineering.

01:27.240 --> 01:30.680
Some of the maths is very difficult, says Mike.

01:30.680 --> 01:33.720
But you must study maths to be an engineer.

01:33.720 --> 01:38.040
Luckily, he got top marks in all his maths exams.

01:38.040 --> 01:40.520
Now he builds robots for industry.

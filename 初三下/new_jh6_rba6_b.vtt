B. People in the UK are always talking about the weather. In the UK, instead of saying,

00:10.360 --> 00:18.800
hello, people sometimes say, it's a lovely day when the weather is sunny or terrible

00:18.800 --> 00:25.880
weather, isn't it? When it is bad. There are many words to describe the weather, too.

00:25.880 --> 00:34.520
Why is this? Perhaps one of the reasons is that the weather in the UK is always changing.

00:34.520 --> 00:41.920
The UK is made up of a group of islands. The sea separates it from the rest of Europe.

00:41.920 --> 00:48.600
The winds coming from the sea make the weather change all the time. On the same day, it

00:48.600 --> 00:57.080
can be hot and cold, dry and wet, windy and still, so people have to think about the weather

00:57.080 --> 01:05.600
all the time. The changing weather is important for farmers. It is sometimes difficult to plan

01:05.600 --> 01:15.160
when to plant and when to pick fruit and vegetables. Too much rain in July and August is harmful

01:15.160 --> 01:23.920
and costs farmers in the UK a lot of money. But it is not only farmers who pay attention to

01:23.920 --> 01:30.920
the weather. Most British people have gardens and they need to watch the weather carefully

01:30.920 --> 01:38.040
to decide what work to do in them. So, there is a good reason for British people to talk

01:38.040 --> 01:42.640
about the weather. It is a very important part of their lives.

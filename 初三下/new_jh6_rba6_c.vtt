00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
See, Victoria and Albert Museum project.

00:06.000 --> 00:15.000
The Victoria and Albert Museum in London has an exciting new project, the World Beach project.

00:15.000 --> 00:22.000
It is an art project open to anybody, anywhere in the world of any age.

00:22.000 --> 00:28.000
Many of us have made simple shapes with sand and stones on beaches.

00:28.000 --> 00:36.000
This project is about making simple shapes with stones of different colours and sizes.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
An artist at the museum started the project.

00:40.000 --> 00:50.000
The rule is that there is no drawing in or digging of sand, just putting stones together and nothing else.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
The project happens in two places.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.000
At the beach, one, find a place to make your shape.

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
Two, look for and collect your stones.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
Three, put your stones in different groups.

01:09.000 --> 01:14.000
You can group them by colour, size or shape.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
Four, make your shape.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.000
Five, keep going until you have finished the shape, run out of stones

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
or have no more ideas.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
Six, take three photos as described below.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
You can take more and then choose the best three.

01:35.000 --> 01:49.000
At your computer, one, select your three photos, one of a beach, one of you working on the shape, one of the finished work.

01:49.000 --> 01:55.000
Two, go to the map page of the website and find your beach.

01:55.000 --> 02:04.000
Three, go to I want to add my beach project to the map to add your three photos.

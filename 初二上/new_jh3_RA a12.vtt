00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
The fastest way to go

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
Going round, galloping fast on a galloping horse

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
That's faster than on my bike, of course

00:38.000 --> 00:44.000
But if you have to travel afar, you're faster again in a motor car

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
And very much faster when riding a train

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
But fastest off all in an aeroplane

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
Flying so high right up in the sky

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
Looking at all their clouds go by

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
Faster than bicycle car or train

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
The fastest off all is an aeroplane

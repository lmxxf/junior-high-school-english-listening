Hello Tony, did you enjoy your visit to New York?

00:06.840 --> 00:13.600
Yes I did. I had a great time. We went to the top of the Empire State Building.

00:13.600 --> 00:17.840
It isn't the tallest building in the world now, but it's still very tall.

00:17.840 --> 00:24.680
Oh yes, all the tourists want to go to the top because you can see all of the city from there.

00:24.680 --> 00:29.680
Yes, and it's one of the most beautiful buildings in New York.

00:29.680 --> 00:31.360
Where else did you go?

00:31.360 --> 00:34.280
We went to the theatre and saw a play.

00:34.280 --> 00:35.520
Did you enjoy it?

00:35.520 --> 00:40.280
Yes I did. It was one of the most popular plays in New York,

00:40.280 --> 00:44.080
and everyone cheered when they saw the famous actors.

00:44.080 --> 00:45.880
What else did you do?

00:45.880 --> 00:51.240
We walked over the Brooklyn Bridge because it's one of the best places to visit in New York.

00:51.240 --> 00:55.240
Yes, it's a fantastic place to see the city from.

00:55.240 --> 00:57.640
Did you stay in a nice hotel?

00:57.640 --> 01:02.240
Yes, but it was one of the most expensive hotels in the city.

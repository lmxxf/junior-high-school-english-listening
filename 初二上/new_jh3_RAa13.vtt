00:00.000 --> 00:06.920
On the north coast of Brazil, scientists once found something very strange.

00:06.920 --> 00:10.600
Lost penguins, far from home.

00:10.600 --> 00:14.800
The scientists did not know why the penguins were lost.

00:14.800 --> 00:19.820
Perhaps a warm current took them north, but penguins cannot live for long in the warmer

00:19.820 --> 00:21.840
waters of the north.

00:21.840 --> 00:25.320
It was time to save the penguins.

00:25.920 --> 00:32.000
Sadly though, some penguins were too sick to travel, and some were dying.

00:32.000 --> 00:37.200
The scientists took the healthy birds and put them on a large aircraft.

00:37.200 --> 00:40.360
They flew to the south coast of Brazil.

00:40.360 --> 00:47.600
Many people came to watch the birds, but at first the birds just looked at the water.

00:47.600 --> 00:51.640
Then some of the braver ones swam about in it.

00:51.640 --> 00:53.240
It was cold.

00:53.240 --> 00:55.520
It was good.

00:55.520 --> 00:59.440
And so they began the last part of their journey.

00:59.440 --> 01:06.120
People cheered loudly as the younger penguins started swimming behind the older ones.

01:06.120 --> 01:09.160
Together they were on their way home at last.

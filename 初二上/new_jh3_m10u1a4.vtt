00:00.000 --> 00:04.600
Hey boys!

00:04.600 --> 00:09.320
Hi Betty, hi Ling Ling, where are you going?

00:09.320 --> 00:11.600
We're going to the park to skate.

00:11.600 --> 00:13.440
There's thick ice on the lake.

00:13.440 --> 00:15.040
Are you coming with us?

00:15.040 --> 00:16.680
Are you joking?

00:16.680 --> 00:18.720
It's really cold today.

00:18.720 --> 00:20.600
And it's cloudy too.

00:20.600 --> 00:22.000
So it might snow.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.200
What's the temperature?

00:24.200 --> 00:28.520
It's between minus 8 and minus 2 degrees.

00:28.520 --> 00:31.320
The temperature is colder here than in England.

00:31.320 --> 00:34.200
Is it snowy in England in December?

00:34.200 --> 00:35.680
Not usually.

00:35.680 --> 00:38.520
Although this year it snowed quite a lot.

00:38.520 --> 00:41.640
Most December's a wet and rainy.

00:41.640 --> 00:45.000
What's the weather like in America in Winter Betty?

00:45.000 --> 00:48.360
We have cold winters and hot summers.

00:48.360 --> 00:51.480
It's snowy in New York in Winter.

00:51.480 --> 00:52.480
Sounds great.

00:52.480 --> 00:57.040
I like sunny weather and I like snow as well.

00:57.040 --> 01:00.120
I don't like showers or windy weather.

01:00.120 --> 01:01.680
Me neither.

01:01.680 --> 01:04.200
Rainy weather is terrible.

01:04.200 --> 01:06.680
I wish I were in Australia now.

01:06.680 --> 01:09.600
It's probably sunny and hot there.

01:09.600 --> 01:13.600
You can go to High Nigh Island if you like sunny weather.

01:13.600 --> 01:15.880
One day I will.

01:15.880 --> 01:18.040
Come on, better get going.

01:18.040 --> 01:20.400
We can skate in the park and get warm.

When is the best time to visit the US?

00:05.200 --> 00:08.280
The US is a very big country.

00:08.280 --> 00:14.200
It is about 3,000 miles from the east coast to the west coast, so choose carefully the

00:14.200 --> 00:17.640
places to see and the time to go.

00:17.640 --> 00:21.400
Bring a map because you may want to travel around.

00:21.400 --> 00:28.560
New York and Washington, DC are good places to visit in May or October, but in winter there

00:28.560 --> 00:30.800
is a lot of snow.

00:30.800 --> 00:34.640
The best time to visit New England is in September.

00:34.640 --> 00:40.480
The weather gets cooler and the green leaves start to turn gold, then brown.

00:40.480 --> 00:45.040
Bring your camera so you can take photos of the autumn trees.

00:45.040 --> 00:51.480
California is on the Pacific coast and the weather is fine all year round.

00:51.480 --> 00:58.360
Take your swimming clothes because you might want to go swimming in the sea even in December.

00:58.360 --> 01:06.360
In Seattle, in the northwest, it is not very cold, but it rains a lot, so bring an umbrella.

01:06.360 --> 01:12.520
In Alaska the days are long and warm in summer, but may be cool in the evening.

01:12.520 --> 01:16.920
In winter, Alaska can be very, very cold.

01:16.920 --> 01:20.840
If you want to visit Alaska you had better go in summer.

01:20.840 --> 01:24.480
Do not forget to bring a warm sweater with you.

01:24.480 --> 01:31.040
In Texas and the southeast, it is usually very hot and sunny compared to other places.

01:31.040 --> 01:35.040
There are storms from time to time in summer and autumn.

01:35.040 --> 01:38.840
So when is the best time to visit the US?

01:38.840 --> 01:40.000

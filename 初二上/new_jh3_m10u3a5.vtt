My name is Peter and I live in Sydney, Australia with my parents.

00:06.200 --> 00:11.280
My grandparents are American and they live in New York.

00:11.280 --> 00:13.880
The weather is very different there.

In July the temperature is often over 30 degrees.

It never snows in Sydney in December because it's the middle of summer.

00:39.360 --> 00:43.960
It's very hot and sunny so we often go to the beach.

It's Ling Ling's birthday tomorrow.

00:03.000 --> 00:06.000
We must get her a present.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
She's too old for a toy.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
She likes playing chess.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
How about a chess set?

00:13.000 --> 00:14.000
Yes.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Or we could buy her things to eat or drink.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
She likes chocolate.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
How about some nice chopsticks?

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
Or a video game?

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
Or how about a baseball cap?

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
I've got it.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
Addictionary.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
Yes.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
An English dictionary.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
She can look up new words in it.

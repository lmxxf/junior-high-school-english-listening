00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Happy birthday, Ling Ling!

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
Here's your gift.

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
Oh, you remembered! What a surprise!

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
You can open it.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
I don't think I should open it now.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
In China, we open a gift later.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
But back in the US, we open a gift immediately.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
So, what do I do?

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
You needn't wait.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
Ling Ling opens her present and finds a dictionary.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
Oh, thank you!

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
I really wanted one.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
We're happy you like it.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
I noticed another difference.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
In China, you accept a gift with both hands.

00:49.000 --> 00:54.000
But in the West, we usually don't pay much attention to that.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
That's interesting.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
I'm interested to know all the Chinese traditions.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Tell me more.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
There are a lot.

01:03.000 --> 01:11.000
For example, in my hometown, people say you mustn't do any cleaning on the first day of the spring festival.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
And you mustn't break anything.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
It's bad luck.

01:15.000 --> 01:21.000
You must only use red paper for hung bow, because red means luck.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
And you'd better not have your hair cut during the spring festival months.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
You can't be serious.

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
And in the north of China, people eat lots of jiao zi.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
Perfect. They taste great.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
I like eating jiao zi too.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
Anyway, the spring festival is still over a month away.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
Let's celebrate Ling Ling's birthday first.

My experiences in England, by Wang Huai.

00:06.480 --> 00:09.000
I went to England last year.

00:09.000 --> 00:15.240
I enjoyed my stay and I noticed something interesting with the English way of life.

00:15.240 --> 00:22.680
For example, you must say, Mr. or Mrs. when you meet someone for the first time.

00:22.680 --> 00:27.880
When you get to know each other better or when they ask you to, you can just use their

00:27.880 --> 00:30.440
first names.

00:30.440 --> 00:36.400
One day we visited some friends and had afternoon tea together.

00:36.400 --> 00:43.120
Afternoon tea is not just a drink, but a light meal at around 4pm.

00:43.120 --> 00:46.680
We eat sandwiches and a large fruitcake.

00:46.680 --> 00:54.360
In England you usually drink tea with milk, so I tried to drink tea with milk too.

00:54.360 --> 00:57.560
Fish and chips is the traditional food in England.

00:57.560 --> 01:02.840
You can buy it and eat it in special fish and chip shops on the high street, or you can

01:02.840 --> 01:06.400
take it away and eat it with your fingers.

01:06.400 --> 01:09.200
It is delicious.

01:09.200 --> 01:14.160
At the bus stop you must not push your way onto the bus.

01:14.160 --> 01:18.680
You need to stand in a line and wait your turn.

01:18.680 --> 01:21.840
Sometimes people are slow to get on the bus.

01:22.160 --> 01:29.000
Once I noticed a gentleman touch a young man on the shoulder, smile politely and say,

01:29.000 --> 01:32.880
excuse me, are you waiting for this bus?

01:32.880 --> 01:34.400
He was really polite.

00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
This morning's class is about first aid, or giving someone basic medical help.

00:10.000 --> 00:16.000
Let's imagine an accident. A boy is lying at the bottom of the stairs.

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
He isn't moving or making a sound. He is in pain.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
What can we do to help him?

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
First of all, find out what's wrong with him.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
How do we do that? Ask him.

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Okay, but he could have trouble hearing you or speaking to you.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
Shout for help. Call 120.

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
Good idea. But what should we do before help arrives?

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
Make him comfortable.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
And how can we do that?

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
Lift him up and sit him on a chair.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
No. That could be harmful.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
You could drop him and hurt him even more.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Betty, you must know.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
You did some basic medical training.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
Make sure he's warm. Cover him with a coat.

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
That's such good advice that you could be a doctor, Betty.

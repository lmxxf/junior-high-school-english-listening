What to do in an earthquake?

00:04.760 --> 00:11.520
Earthquakes always happens suddenly, so it is difficult to warn people about them.

00:11.520 --> 00:17.400
Usually people have little or no idea about what to do during an earthquake, so here is

00:17.400 --> 00:20.000
some advice.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
Inside.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.000
One.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.440
Do not jump out of high buildings.

00:25.440 --> 00:26.440
Two.

00:26.440 --> 00:28.560
Hide under a table.

00:28.560 --> 00:31.800
Stay away from windows and heavy furniture.

00:31.800 --> 00:34.000
Keep clear of fires.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.080
Three.

00:36.080 --> 00:40.240
Leave the building quickly when the ground stops shaking.

00:40.240 --> 00:43.080
But do not use the lift.

00:43.080 --> 00:44.440
Four.

00:44.440 --> 00:48.400
Keep calm, especially when you are with other people.

00:48.400 --> 00:52.320
Be brave and be helpful.

00:52.320 --> 00:53.320
Outside.

00:53.320 --> 00:55.320
One.

00:55.320 --> 01:00.320
Move away from buildings, because parts of a building may fall on you.

01:00.320 --> 01:01.320
Two.

01:01.320 --> 01:06.720
Do not stand near streetlights or under power lines.

01:06.720 --> 01:08.720
Three.

01:08.720 --> 01:11.560
Stay away from bridges and trees.

01:11.560 --> 01:15.760
If you are in a bus or car, stay in it.

01:15.760 --> 01:16.760
Four.

01:16.760 --> 01:21.600
In the mountains, be careful of falling rocks.

01:21.600 --> 01:23.480
Five.

01:23.480 --> 01:29.160
On a beach, run away from the sea and move quickly to higher ground.

01:29.160 --> 01:33.320
In short, follow what you learnt in school.

01:33.320 --> 01:36.640
You can be safe and you can also help save others.

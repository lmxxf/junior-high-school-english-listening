00:00.000 --> 00:04.080
We were having dinner at home when the earthquake happened.

00:04.080 --> 00:08.960
The room started to shake, and before we knew what was happening, father shouted to

00:08.960 --> 00:12.360
everyone to get under the kitchen table.

00:12.360 --> 00:16.240
We all sat on the floor under the table and waited.

00:16.240 --> 00:22.160
When the ground stopped shaking, we got up, and we weren't hurt.

00:22.160 --> 00:26.640
We couldn't get out of the room because the door wouldn't open.

00:26.640 --> 00:33.360
My father called for help on his mobile phone, and in three hours, people came to help us.

00:33.360 --> 00:35.080
They opened the door.

00:35.080 --> 00:37.200
We got up and left our flat.

A ten-year-old girl saved about 100 other tourists in 2004 by warning them that as tsunami,

00:09.160 --> 00:14.040
a huge ocean wave was on its way across the sea.

00:14.040 --> 00:19.480
She knew what was happening because she learnt about underwater earthquakes at school, only

00:19.480 --> 00:22.800
a few weeks earlier, a newspaper reported.

00:22.800 --> 00:27.400
I was on the beach and the water started to go funny.

00:27.400 --> 00:30.680
Tilly Smith told the reporter from the newspaper.

00:30.680 --> 00:34.680
There were bubbles and the water went back suddenly.

00:34.680 --> 00:37.960
I knew there was going to be a tsunami.

00:37.960 --> 00:39.720
I told Mum.

00:39.720 --> 00:40.920
She said.

00:40.920 --> 00:45.000
Tilly's mother and the hotel workers acted quickly.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.680
They cleared people from the beach just minutes before a huge wave reached the land.

00:50.680 --> 00:53.480
Luckily no one died.

00:53.480 --> 00:56.600
Tilly's teacher was very proud of her.

00:56.600 --> 00:59.000
She's a very clever girl.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.240
It is very lucky that our class were learning about this kind of tsunami just two weeks before

01:05.240 --> 01:06.360
Christmas.

01:06.360 --> 01:07.560
He told the newspaper.

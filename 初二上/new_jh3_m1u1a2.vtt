One. I have a question. What does spring mean?

00:06.080 --> 00:13.600
Spring. Spring is a season. It comes after winter and before summer.

00:13.600 --> 00:18.400
Try to remember our famous spring festival, Darming.

00:18.400 --> 00:23.840
Oh, I understand. Two.

00:23.840 --> 00:28.920
Lingling, your grammar isn't correct. You made a mistake.

00:29.080 --> 00:35.720
It's not yesterday I go to the cinema, but yesterday I went.

00:35.720 --> 00:44.200
Good. Today I have an English lesson. Yesterday I had.

00:44.200 --> 00:55.400
Three. How do you spell cinema? I know how to pronounce it, but does it begin with S or C?

00:55.720 --> 01:01.400
What do you think? How do you check the spelling of a word, Darming?

01:01.400 --> 01:09.400
Well, I usually look it up in the dictionary, but this one is difficult because I don't know the first letter.

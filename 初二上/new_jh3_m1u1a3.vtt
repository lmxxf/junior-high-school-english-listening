Welcome back everyone. Today we're going to talk about good ways to learn English. Ready?

00:11.160 --> 00:18.840
Who has some advice? We should always speak English in class. Good. Let's try to speak

00:18.840 --> 00:25.440
English as much as possible. Why not write down our mistakes in our notebooks?

00:25.440 --> 00:32.440
That's a good idea and don't forget to write down the correct answers next to the mistakes.

00:32.440 --> 00:39.440
What else? It's a good idea to spell and pronounce new words aloud every day.

00:39.440 --> 00:45.160
Thanks a lot Ling Ling. How about listening to the radio?

00:45.160 --> 00:52.160
Yes, that's good for our pronunciation too. But there are so many new words.

00:52.160 --> 01:00.160
You don't need to understand every word. You just need to listen for key words and main ideas.

01:00.160 --> 01:09.160
That's the same for reading. English stories are so interesting. I get to know a lot about the world through reading.

01:09.160 --> 01:18.160
I think writing is also important. Why don't we try to find some English pen friends? We can write to them.

01:18.160 --> 01:22.160
Excellent. I agree with you.

Many students ask for advice about how to improve their English. Here are three basic questions.

00:17.000 --> 00:22.760
The first question is about understanding English films and songs.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.520

00:26.520 --> 00:32.360
I like watching English films and listening to English songs,

00:32.360 --> 00:38.360
but I don't understand very much. What can I do?

00:38.360 --> 00:44.040
Watching films and listening to songs are great ways to learn English.

00:44.040 --> 00:49.800
Watch and listen several times and guess the meaning of the new words.

00:49.880 --> 00:58.920
Each time you will learn something new, I also advise you to talk about the films or songs with your friends.

00:58.920 --> 01:07.160
The second question is about speaking. Wang Fan from Gillian wrote,

01:07.160 --> 01:14.440
Our school has a teacher from the US. I am Shi and I am afraid to speak to her.

01:14.440 --> 01:17.800
What should I do? You can say,

01:17.880 --> 01:25.240
Hello, how are you? Do you like China? These are good ways to start a conversation.

01:26.040 --> 01:34.600
And before you begin, you should smile at her. Remember this, do not be shy, just try.

01:35.720 --> 01:42.520
The third question is about vocabulary. Zhang Lei from An Quay wrote,

01:42.600 --> 01:49.800
I write down new words, but I forget them quickly. How can I remember them?

01:49.800 --> 01:58.920
Do not worry, it is natural to forget new words. I suggest you write four or five words a day

01:58.920 --> 02:06.920
on pieces of paper and place them in your room. Read the words when you see them and try to use them.

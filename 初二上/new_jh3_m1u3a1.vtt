Hi Charlie, what's wrong?

00:03.000 --> 00:08.000
Hi Mary, this English homework is really difficult.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
Why don't we work on it together?

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
Yes, okay. How about meeting after school today?

00:15.000 --> 00:22.000
Good idea. We should tell our classmates maybe other students would like to join us.

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
Yes, we can start an English study club.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
Let's try to meet every Monday afternoon after school.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
Can you send everyone an email about our club?

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
That way, everyone will know about it.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
Don't forget to put the time and place on it.

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
We should read some newspapers and help each other with difficult vocabulary.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
Good idea. Let's go and write the email now.

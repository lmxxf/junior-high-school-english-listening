Hey, Doming. How was your weekend? Pretty good. I went to Shen Zhen. Where's Shen Zhen?

00:13.000 --> 00:23.000
Well, it's on the coast near Hong Kong. It was a small village about 30 years ago, but today it's a very big city.

00:23.000 --> 00:37.000
So, it's a newer city than Hong Kong. Yes, it's a very new city. In fact, it only became important in the 1980s. It's getting bigger and busier.

00:37.000 --> 00:47.000
Someday, it will become as busy as Hong Kong, I'm sure. What's the population of Shen Zhen? It's over 10 million, I think.

00:47.000 --> 00:57.000
That's larger than the population of many other cities in China. It streets are much wider and cleaner too. I think it's a beautiful city.

00:57.000 --> 01:07.000
I'd like to go there one day. Remember to visit the D1 Tower. It's taller than many other buildings in Shen Zhen.

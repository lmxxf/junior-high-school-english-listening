Cambridge, London and England by Tony Smith.

00:06.400 --> 00:11.760
I come from Cambridge, a beautiful city in the east of England.

00:11.760 --> 00:18.860
It is on the river Kam and has a population of about 120,000.

00:18.860 --> 00:23.640
My hometown is especially famous for its university.

00:23.640 --> 00:30.840
Many famous people studied here, such as Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin.

00:30.840 --> 00:34.760
There are lots of old buildings and churches to visit.

00:34.760 --> 00:39.840
Students and tourists enjoy trips along the river by boat.

00:39.840 --> 00:44.080
Cambridge is 80 kilometres from London.

00:44.080 --> 00:49.560
London is in the south of England and it is on the river Thames.

00:49.560 --> 00:58.280
It has a population of about 7 and a half million, so it is bigger and busier than Cambridge.

00:58.280 --> 01:08.080
It is about 2,000 years old and it is famous for big Ben, Buckingham Palace and Tower Bridge.

01:08.080 --> 01:13.960
England itself is part of an island and you are always near the sea.

01:13.960 --> 01:19.480
The small villages and beaches on the coast are popular for holidays.

01:19.480 --> 01:25.920
Tourists like the areas of low mountains and beautiful lakes in the north and the hills

01:25.920 --> 01:28.920
and pretty villages in the south.

01:28.920 --> 01:33.640
Everywhere in England you will notice how green the countryside is.

01:33.640 --> 01:39.120
It is never very hot in summer or very cold in winter.

01:39.120 --> 01:43.520
So come and see England any time of the year.

01:43.520 --> 01:45.880
But bring an umbrella with you.

01:45.880 --> 01:47.400
You will need it most days.

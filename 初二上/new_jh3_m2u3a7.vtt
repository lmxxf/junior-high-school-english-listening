Is New York the capital of the US Betty?

00:03.560 --> 00:08.200
No, it isn't. Washington, D.C. is the capital.

00:08.200 --> 00:11.200
But some people think the capital is New York,

00:11.200 --> 00:16.400
because New York is a bigger and busier city than Washington, D.C.

00:16.400 --> 00:22.200
I see. New York is more famous than any other city in the US, right?

00:22.200 --> 00:24.400
Yes, I think it is.

00:24.400 --> 00:29.600
And which Chinese city is bigger? Shanghai or Beijing?

00:30.000 --> 00:33.800
Well, Shanghai has a larger population.

00:33.800 --> 00:39.800
Really? And which city is older, Beijing or Shanghai?

00:39.800 --> 00:43.800
Well, that's a good question.

00:43.800 --> 00:49.400
They are both very old cities, but Beijing is older than Shanghai.

00:49.400 --> 00:51.800
That's very interesting.

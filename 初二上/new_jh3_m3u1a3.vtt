00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Hey Tony, come and watch the football match on TV.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
Okay, what's the score?

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
Spain scored a minute ago.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
Wow, that's fast.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.000
That's right.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
Last week the match on TV was so boring

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
because no one scored at all.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
So this week's match is already more exciting.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
What's the matter with you Tony?

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
You look tired.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
I'm really tired after last night's tennis match.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
And I hurt my knee.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
That's too bad.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
Sit down and watch the match.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
It's safer than playing tennis.

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
Yes, watching is not dangerous and it's more relaxing too.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
Well, I'm not sure about that.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
Nothing is more enjoyable than playing tennis.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
But you enjoyed watching the Olympics on TV, right?

00:54.000 --> 00:59.000
Yes, but that's because it was cheaper than buying tickets for all the games.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
And staying at home was easier than going to the stadium.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
Oh, look at that.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Oh, he missed.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Or bad luck.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Never mind.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
There's still plenty of time for them to score.

00:00.000 --> 00:05.720
Training hard by Lee Daming.

00:05.720 --> 00:09.920
It is Saturday tomorrow, but I am going to school.

00:09.920 --> 00:14.040
I am not going for lessons, but to play football.

00:14.040 --> 00:19.600
I am in our school team, and we are going to play against another school next week.

00:19.600 --> 00:23.080
The practice starts at 10am.

00:23.080 --> 00:28.040
We all arrive as early as we can, so that we have time to warm up.

00:28.040 --> 00:33.640
We are training harder than usual because the other team beat us last year.

00:33.640 --> 00:37.200
This year we want to do better.

00:37.200 --> 00:42.560
It is more difficult to practice in winter because the days are short and the weather is

00:42.560 --> 00:44.640
cold too.

00:44.640 --> 00:51.360
It gets dark earlier, so it is important not to be late for after school practice.

00:51.360 --> 00:56.520
Our coach is pleased because we are playing better as a team now.

00:56.520 --> 01:01.480
Last year we were sometimes careless when we passed the ball and we lost to the other

01:01.480 --> 01:04.040
team in the final match.

01:04.040 --> 01:06.000
What a pity.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.640
This year we are training more carefully.

01:09.640 --> 01:13.520
That means we have a better chance of winning.

01:13.520 --> 01:16.840
The fan club has fewer people this year.

01:16.840 --> 01:21.880
We hope to play well so that we have more fans to watch the matches.

01:21.880 --> 01:24.560
It is good to have our fans around.

01:24.560 --> 01:28.920
It's always a cheer us on loudly and we feel more confident to win the game.

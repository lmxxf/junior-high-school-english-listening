Bang! Everyone started to run quickly. The students around the playground all shouted

00:07.400 --> 00:16.560
loudly. Come on! Come on! Children from eight different classes all ran fast. They were

00:16.560 --> 00:26.400
in the girls 800 meters. At first, Sandy from class one ran faster than any other girls.

00:26.400 --> 00:34.360
After two minutes, she was still in first place. But later, Joy from class four got faster

00:34.360 --> 00:42.720
and faster. Sandy ran more slowly and she looked tired and sad. Something was wrong with

00:42.720 --> 00:45.840
her foot. Joy was first.

A lot of people around the world enjoy jogging.

00:04.440 --> 00:09.800
Jogging means running slowly, but it is still faster than walking.

00:09.800 --> 00:17.040
In the mornings and evenings you can see people jogging in parks or along city streets.

00:17.040 --> 00:20.400
Jogging is cheaper than many sports.

00:20.400 --> 00:26.000
To start, just get some comfortable sports clothes and good running shoes.

00:26.400 --> 00:30.320
I enjoy jogging with my friends, Tommy and Anna.

00:30.320 --> 00:34.560
In the early mornings we often go jogging in the park.

00:34.560 --> 00:37.600
Then we are ready for school.

00:37.600 --> 00:42.080
At weekends we sometimes go jogging in the countryside.

00:42.080 --> 00:48.000
It is more fun than jogging in the city and we feel good in the fresh air.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.600
The more you go jogging, the healthier you will feel.

00:51.600 --> 00:53.200
Just try it.

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
I was late for school today.

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
Why? What happened?

00:07.000 --> 00:11.000
I took the bus. There was a road accident.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
And the traffic was very heavy.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
But nobody was late except me.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
Maybe I should go to school by taxi.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
It's the most comfortable way.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
But it's also the most expensive.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
And taxis are very slow in heavy traffic too.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
Then what about going by bike?

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
That's a good choice.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
But it's a bit dangerous.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
There's so much traffic.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
But most of my classmates ride bikes.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
And it's quite safe. Don't worry. I'll be careful.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
How does Tony go to school?

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
He lives the farthest from school.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
So he takes the underground.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
And what about Ling Ling?

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
Her home is the closest to school. So she walks.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
Now about Daming.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
He goes by bus too.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
The same as me.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
But it's so crowded. And the traffic is heavy.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
All right. You can ride your bike to school.

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
But remember to be careful all the time.

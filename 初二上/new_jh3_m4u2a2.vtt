Question. What is the best way to travel from London to Amsterdam?

00:07.000 --> 00:13.720
I am planning to travel from London to Amsterdam. How long does the journey take and what is the

00:13.720 --> 00:19.840
best way to travel? Could you please tell me about the trains or ships to get there?

00:19.840 --> 00:23.920
The more information the better. Thanks.

00:23.920 --> 00:31.520
First answer. There are four ways to travel. A journey by train is more relaxing than by

00:31.520 --> 00:39.640
coach, but a lot more expensive. When you go by train, buy your ticket a long time before

00:39.640 --> 00:46.960
you travel. It is usually cheaper. You can go by car and by ship across the North

00:46.960 --> 00:54.840
Sea. This is the most comfortable way to travel, but also the most expensive. Book your ticket

00:54.840 --> 01:02.840
before you book your hotel. Remember that parking in Amsterdam is very expensive, so stay

01:02.840 --> 01:09.280
outside the city centre and travel in by bus or by train.

01:09.280 --> 01:16.440
The third choice is by coach. This is usually the cheapest, but in summer the coaches sometimes

01:16.440 --> 01:23.520
get crowded. And it takes you about 12 hours to get there. However, it will not cost as much

01:23.520 --> 01:31.520
as going by train. Finally, you can fly. It is the fastest and the second cheapest, but

01:31.520 --> 01:36.960
you may have to wait for hours at the airport because of bad weather. Well, I hope this

01:36.960 --> 01:39.000
helps. Have a great trip.

Lingling and I went to Laosiua Tea House last night.

00:07.360 --> 00:08.680
How was it?

00:08.680 --> 00:10.440
It was great.

00:10.440 --> 00:13.640
You know I wanted to see the Beijing Opera.

00:13.640 --> 00:16.440
So Lingling offered to take me there.

00:16.440 --> 00:19.400
We drank tea and watched an opera.

00:19.400 --> 00:21.560
Did you understand the opera?

00:21.560 --> 00:22.560
No.

00:22.560 --> 00:25.160
It was difficult to understand the words.

00:25.160 --> 00:28.480
But the actors and actresses were excellent.

00:28.480 --> 00:30.120
How long did you stay?

00:30.120 --> 00:32.560
We only planned to watch for an hour.

00:32.560 --> 00:35.960
But in the end, we stayed for three hours.

00:35.960 --> 00:37.440
Did you enjoy it?

00:37.440 --> 00:39.280
Well, it was interesting.

00:39.280 --> 00:41.360
That's the main thing.

00:41.360 --> 00:44.480
I hope to understand more next time.

00:44.480 --> 00:47.560
Do you often go to see the Beijing Opera Lingling?

00:47.560 --> 00:49.200
No, I don't.

00:49.200 --> 00:53.280
I wanted to take Betty to the Tea House because it's famous.

00:53.280 --> 00:55.040
Who is Laosiua?

00:55.040 --> 00:56.720
No idea.

00:56.720 --> 00:58.160
Ask Lingling.

00:58.160 --> 01:01.320
Laosiua is a great writer.

01:01.320 --> 01:04.840
He's especially famous for his play, Tea House.

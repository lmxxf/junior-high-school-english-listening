Hello Steve, are you enjoying your visit to London?

00:05.200 --> 00:07.280
Thank you for asking Vicki.

00:07.280 --> 00:09.400
I'm having a great time.

00:09.400 --> 00:12.360
We went to Shakespeare's Globe Theatre last night.

00:12.360 --> 00:15.040
Oh yes, it's great.

00:15.040 --> 00:17.440
A lot of tourists want to go there.

00:17.440 --> 00:23.800
Yes, my uncle offered to take us and we decided to see Romeo and Juliet.

00:23.800 --> 00:25.960
Did you understand the play?

00:25.960 --> 00:29.240
Well, I tried to understand the words.

00:29.240 --> 00:33.200
It was very difficult, but I know the story.

00:33.200 --> 00:36.320
I hope to see Romeo and Juliet too.

00:36.320 --> 00:38.840
It's my favourite play.

00:38.840 --> 00:40.920
Will your parents agree to take you?

00:40.920 --> 00:42.480
Yes, I'm sure they will.

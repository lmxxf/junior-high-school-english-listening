Review of Teahouse by Li Da Ming

00:05.720 --> 00:10.000
This year's school play was a very good choice.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.360
Teahouse by Lao Shu'a is famous and interesting.

00:15.360 --> 00:21.200
We learnt a lot about people's lives in China some 100 years ago.

00:21.200 --> 00:27.120
The actors and actresses' clothes and the Teahouse furniture were right for the first half

00:27.120 --> 00:29.840
of the 20th century.

00:29.840 --> 00:34.440
The actors and actresses all did a very good job.

00:34.440 --> 00:41.480
Li Nan, the student playing Wang Li Far, the owner of the Teahouse was the best.

00:41.480 --> 00:47.920
He brought Wang Li Far to life from a young man to an old man.

00:47.920 --> 00:50.680
I had a great time at the theatre.

00:50.680 --> 00:57.320
It was easy for everyone to understand the story and see the changes in Chinese society.

Are you watching Animal World?

00:04.720 --> 00:09.440
Yes, I'm watching it to find out about different animals.

00:09.440 --> 00:11.800
This week it's about snakes.

00:11.800 --> 00:17.480
Oh, last week they told us why there were so few pandas.

00:17.480 --> 00:21.480
They made the program to show people how the animals live.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.680
Yes, I saw it.

00:23.680 --> 00:27.200
Now I understand why pandas are so special.

00:27.200 --> 00:29.920
But we want other animals to be safe too.

00:29.920 --> 00:34.520
There aren't many lions, elephants and bears left in the world.

00:34.520 --> 00:36.240
It's good to find out about them.

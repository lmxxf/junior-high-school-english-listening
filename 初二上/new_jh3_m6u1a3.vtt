00:00.000 --> 00:03.600
Lingling and Betty are leaving the zoo.

00:03.600 --> 00:06.200
Did you like the zoo?

00:06.200 --> 00:13.160
Yes, I saw the pandas at last, but I am more interested to see the pandas in the war-long

00:13.160 --> 00:18.000
panda reserve because it allows people to get closer to them.

00:18.000 --> 00:22.040
It's sad to think of pandas and other animals in danger.

00:22.040 --> 00:24.160
We need to protect them better.

00:24.160 --> 00:29.960
Yes, many wild animals don't have a safe place to live, because villages and farms

00:29.960 --> 00:34.560
are growing bigger and are taking away their land and forests.

00:34.560 --> 00:38.520
Also, often there isn't enough clean water.

00:38.520 --> 00:42.200
I think we all need to help animals live in peace.

00:42.200 --> 00:44.640
Look, there's a notice.

00:44.640 --> 00:47.160
It says, help!

00:47.160 --> 00:51.720
We want to save animals in danger and we need your help.

00:51.720 --> 00:53.640
But what can we do?

00:53.640 --> 00:58.880
It says, your money pays to look after the animals.

00:58.920 --> 01:02.800
That means we can give money to help protect the animals.

01:02.800 --> 01:06.000
Maybe we can raise some money at school.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.680
Let's find out what else we can do to save as many animals as possible.

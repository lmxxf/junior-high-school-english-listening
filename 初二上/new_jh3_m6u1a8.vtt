Hello everyone and welcome to our first meeting of the Wildlife Club.

00:08.000 --> 00:13.000
First, let me tell you why we want to start this club.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
We want to help animals in danger.

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
We decided to start a club in order to get more ideas.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
We'd like more students to come to our meetings.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
Why don't we send an email to everyone to tell them about the club

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
and about what we hope to do here?

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Good idea. And maybe we should decide which kind of animals to help.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
Let's ask the zoo for information.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
We need to tell people about animals in danger.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
Lots of us buy presents when we go on holidays

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
and some of the presents are made from animals,

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
but many people don't know that.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
Yes, it's very bad.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
People use snake skins to make bags.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
We need to send that email right now.

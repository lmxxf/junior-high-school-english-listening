Dear Miss Jones, how are you?

00:04.720 --> 00:07.160
I hope you are having a good summer.

00:07.160 --> 00:11.360
I am having a great time here in the south of England.

00:11.360 --> 00:17.400
Yesterday we visited Marwell Wildlife, a zoo near the south coast.

00:17.400 --> 00:20.760
The zoo helps wild animals in danger.

00:20.760 --> 00:23.760
We saw many kinds of animals there.

00:23.760 --> 00:26.440
There are giraffes and elephants.

00:26.440 --> 00:29.040
They even have penguins.

00:29.040 --> 00:32.360
There are lots of scientists working at the zoo.

00:32.360 --> 00:37.840
They do important research to find out the best ways to protect animals.

00:37.840 --> 00:42.040
They also develop plans to help animals in danger.

00:42.040 --> 00:45.960
I will tell you more about it when I see you after the holiday.

00:45.960 --> 00:47.440
Yours, Sally.

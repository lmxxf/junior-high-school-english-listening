00:00.000 --> 00:08.220
Pandas are in danger. There are only about 1,600 pandas in the wild today.

00:08.220 --> 00:15.000
Zoos and research centres are looking after about 340 pandas.

00:15.000 --> 00:21.000
Pandas do not have many babies, and baby pandas often die.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
The situation is getting very difficult.

00:24.500 --> 00:33.000
Scientists are doing a lot of research to help pandas produce more babies and help baby pandas live.

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
Pandas live in the forests and mountains of southwest China.

00:37.000 --> 00:42.000
Each panda needs to eat a lot of bamboo every day.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.000
The bamboo forests are getting smaller, so pandas are losing their home.

00:48.000 --> 00:56.000
In order to protect pandas in the wild, the government is setting up nature parks and developing other plans.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.000
The nature parks will be big, and there will be more bamboo to feed the pandas.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
Pandas born in zoos may go back to live in the nature parks.

01:07.000 --> 01:16.000
The worldwide fund for nature, WWF, wants to protect all animals, and it shows the panda to be its symbol.

01:16.000 --> 01:26.000
We do not want to lose tigers, elephants, or any other animals, so the WWF is working hard to save them all.

Hi, Lingling.

00:02.000 --> 00:03.000
Shh!

00:03.000 --> 00:04.500
I'm reading.

00:04.500 --> 00:07.000
Sorry. What's the book about?

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
It's about a girl called Alice.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
One day Alice was sitting with her sister by the river

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
and she saw a white rabbit with a watch.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
It ran past.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.500
Why was it running?

00:20.500 --> 00:22.500
Because it was late.

00:22.500 --> 00:24.500
And where was it going?

00:24.500 --> 00:27.000
To see the Queen of Hearts.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Alice followed it and fell down a hole in the ground.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
Yes.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
Then she saw the Cheshire cat.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
It was sitting in a tree and smiling at everyone.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
Then Alice arrived at the March hares house.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
He was sitting with the mad hatter and a mouse.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
They were having a tea party in the garden.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
And then Alice met the Queen of Hearts.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
She was playing a strange game.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
Do you already know the book?

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Yes.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
It's Alice's adventures in Wonderland.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Everyone in Britain knows the story.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
Then why did you ask me all those questions?

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
To see if you remember the story.

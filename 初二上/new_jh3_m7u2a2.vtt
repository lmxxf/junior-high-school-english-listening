Alice was sitting with her sister by the river and her sister was reading a book. Alice had

00:10.420 --> 00:17.120
nothing to do. Once or twice she looked into her sister's book.

00:17.120 --> 00:25.360
And what is a book for, thought Alice? Without pictures or conversations. Suddenly, a white

00:25.360 --> 00:39.320
rabbit with pink eyes ran by. There was nothing strange about that. She heard the rabbit say,

00:39.320 --> 00:48.540
oh dear, oh dear, I'll be late. And she did not think it was strange. Then the rabbit took a

00:48.540 --> 00:58.480
watch out of its pocket and looked at it. A rabbit with a pocket and a watch. Alice got up and ran

00:58.480 --> 01:09.700
across the field after it. She saw it go down a large rabbit hole in the ground. Then Alice went

01:09.700 --> 01:16.460
down after it, but never thought about how she was going to get out again. She found that she was

01:16.460 --> 01:24.900
falling down a very, very deep hole. It was too dark for her to see anything. She was falling for a

01:24.900 --> 01:34.540
long time. While she was falling, she was thinking about her cat, Diner. Suddenly, she landed on some dry leaves.

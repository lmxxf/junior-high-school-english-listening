One day I was with my friends. We were having a picnic in a field, and I saw something strange.

00:08.640 --> 00:14.920
There was a white cat with a pink nose sitting in a tree. There's nothing strange about

00:14.920 --> 00:22.680
that, of course, but it looked like it was eating the leaves in the tree. That was strange.

00:22.680 --> 00:25.920
Cats don't usually eat leaves.

00:26.320 --> 00:29.600
Maybe it's very hungry, I thought.

00:31.840 --> 00:38.080
While I was looking at it, the cat got out of the tree, jumped down to the ground,

00:38.080 --> 00:41.600
and walked across the field and sat next to us.

00:42.400 --> 00:48.000
Maybe it wanted some of our picnic to eat, but there was nothing for a cat.

00:48.880 --> 00:54.960
The cat got up and came close to me. I talked to it, and it smiled at me.

00:56.880 --> 00:58.640
Was it a chesher cat?

00:59.600 --> 01:06.960
I found some biscuits in my pocket and gave them to the cat. Soon it was eating biscuits and

01:06.960 --> 01:13.600
smiling at us. Then, after a while, the cat got up and walked across the field.

01:14.320 --> 01:17.440
Maybe it wasn't hungry anymore.

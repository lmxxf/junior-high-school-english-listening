00:00.000 --> 00:05.980
The mad hatter, the march hair and the mouse are having a tea party.

00:05.980 --> 00:09.000
Alice arrives and sits down.

00:11.000 --> 00:16.000
It wasn't very polite of you to sit down. We didn't ask you.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
I didn't know it was your table.

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
Anyway, there are cups of tea for more than three people.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
That's because it's always tea time.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
I don't understand.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
You don't have time to wash the things.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
So we just move round the table.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
Stop singing, mouse.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
He's asleep.

00:52.000 --> 01:01.000
Oh, I wasn't asleep. I heard every word you were saying.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Tell us a story.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
Yes, please do.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
And be quick, or you'll be asleep again before it's done.

01:10.000 --> 01:18.000
Once upon a time, there were three little sisters, and they lived.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Take some more tea.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
I didn't have any tea, so I can't have more.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
You mean you can't take less.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
It's very easy to take more than nothing.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
Nobody asked you.

01:33.000 --> 01:38.000
I want a clean cup. Let's all move one place.

01:38.000 --> 01:43.000
The mad hatter moves, and the mouse follows him.

01:43.000 --> 01:49.000
The march hair knocks the milk over when he is moving into the mouse's place.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
Alice takes the place of the march hair.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.000
Alice is not happy, because there is milk on the table in front of her.

02:03.000 --> 02:11.000
Well, really, this is the stupidest tea party I've been to in all my life.

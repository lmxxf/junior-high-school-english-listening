00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
How did the accident happen?

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
I was driving along the road and...

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
How fast were you going at the time?

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
I wasn't going fast.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
Where were you going?

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
I was going along the road, just here.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
Where was the boy on the bike going?

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
I didn't see him.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
Were you looking?

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
No, I wasn't.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
Were you using your mobile phone?

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
Yes, I was.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
So, that's not good.

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
You mustn't use your mobile phone while you were driving.

Good morning, Miss James. You look pale. Are you alright?

00:09.360 --> 00:17.000
I'm okay, but I saw an accident. A boy was riding his bike and listening to music on

00:17.000 --> 00:25.360
the road. That's very dangerous. I was waiting to cross the road. While the lights were

00:25.360 --> 00:32.560
changing to red, a car suddenly appeared round the corner. It wasn't going fast, but it

00:32.560 --> 00:40.360
didn't stop. Did the boy stop? No. And the driver was talking on his mobile phone.

00:40.360 --> 00:48.800
So did the car hit the boy? No, I'm glad to say. The car stopped just in time, but the

00:48.800 --> 00:56.960
boy fell off his bike and hurt his knee. That's too bad. So when you're on your bike, think

00:56.960 --> 01:06.000
about the risk of an accident. Pay attention. Stop at the red lights and what else? Don't ride too

01:06.000 --> 01:14.480
fast. Don't ride side by side with your friends. Anything else? Don't listen to music.

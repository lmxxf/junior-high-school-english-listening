Smile please. One day when Henry was working in a restaurant, a snake suddenly appeared

00:08.600 --> 00:16.400
and bit his hand. A few days earlier, the snake arrived from Asia in a box of bananas.

00:16.400 --> 00:24.360
It climbed out and hid somewhere. I was trying to pick it up when it bit me again. I threw

00:24.360 --> 00:31.640
it across the kitchen and it landed on a table. While the snake was lying on the table, Henry

00:31.640 --> 00:37.720
quickly picked up his mobile phone and took a photo with it. Then the snake hid behind

00:37.720 --> 00:45.040
the fridge. When Henry was trying to find the snake, his hand began to hurt badly. He

00:45.040 --> 00:52.080
hurried to hospital. As the doctors were checking him, the pain got worse. But they could

00:52.080 --> 00:58.480
not help him because they did not know what kind of snake bit him. As he was lying there

00:58.480 --> 01:07.160
in great pain, Henry suddenly remembered the photo. The doctors sent the photo to a zoo.

01:07.160 --> 01:13.160
As soon as they learnt what kind of snake bit him, they gave Henry the right medicine

01:13.160 --> 01:20.440
and he left hospital the next day. So if a snake bites you, take out your mobile

01:20.440 --> 01:26.560
phone or camera, take its photo and show the photo to the doctors.

01:26.560 --> 01:32.280
Suggest Henry. But as you know, the snake won't smile.

And finally, a story about a lucky cat. Here's Alice to tell us what happened.

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Yes. At about four o'clock yesterday afternoon, I was reading a book in the sitting room.

00:14.000 --> 00:22.000
I heard a strange sound from the next room. I went in to look and saw my cat, Pete.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
He was looking into the fishbowl and trying to get a fish from the bowl.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
And then what happened?

00:29.000 --> 00:35.000
The fishbowl fell on Pete. I went to pick him up because he doesn't like water.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
I took him to the bathroom and dried him.

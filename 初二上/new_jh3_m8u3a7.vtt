Kairless Jack My friend Jack was always having accidents.

00:06.760 --> 00:11.920
He did not pay attention to where he was going or what he was doing.

00:11.920 --> 00:17.080
A few months ago a car hit him while he was on his way home from school.

00:17.080 --> 00:21.440
The driver was a bit tired so he did not see Jack.

00:21.440 --> 00:27.360
And Jack was talking on his mobile phone and was riding in the middle of the road.

00:27.360 --> 00:34.600
The car hit him, he broke his leg and was in hospital for over a month.

00:34.600 --> 00:38.560
Last week he fell down a hole in the park.

00:38.560 --> 00:42.560
As usual he was not looking where he was going.

00:42.560 --> 00:47.960
Some kindhearted people in the park helped him climb out of the hole and then took him

00:47.960 --> 00:51.840
to hospital because he was in a lot of pain.

00:51.840 --> 00:56.520
Luckily he did not break an arm or a leg.

00:56.520 --> 01:02.480
At the hospital the doctors gave him some medicine and then he went home.

01:02.480 --> 01:08.600
I always told him to be careful but he did not listen to me.

01:08.600 --> 01:13.760
After the two accidents he promised to take my advice.

01:13.760 --> 01:15.480
Now he is very careful.

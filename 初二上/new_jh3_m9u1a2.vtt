I went shopping in the city center with my family last week.

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
Did you have a good time?

00:07.000 --> 00:11.000
Yes, I did, but there was a lot of traffic on the way there.

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
Then there were too many people and not enough space.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
It was impossible to move, and there was a lot of noise.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Well, Beijing is a big city.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
Yes, it is. It has a population of about 20 million.

00:27.000 --> 00:33.000
20 million? Does Beijing have the largest population in China?

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
No, it doesn't. Chongqing has the largest population in China.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
More than 33 million people live there.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
Really? That's a lot of people.

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
Yes, and there's a lot more pollution in the air.

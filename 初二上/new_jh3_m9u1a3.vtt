00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
What are you doing?

00:02.000 --> 00:08.000
I'm preparing some notes for a report called our growing population.

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
Well, we're in the right place to talk about that.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
Beijing is a huge city with a large population.

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
That causes a lot of problems, such as too much traffic and noise.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
It's not only Beijing, population increases a big problem in many countries.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Do you know how many babies are born every minute in the world?

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
No, can you tell me?

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
Over 250.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
That makes over 131.4 million births a year.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
I can't believe it!

00:44.000 --> 00:50.000
The population of China is about 1.37 billion.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
That's almost one-fifth of the world's population.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
That is about 7 billion.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
Hang on a minute. I'll write that down too.

00:59.000 --> 01:06.000
But in the future, China's population won't grow so fast because families are getting smaller.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
How do you know all this?

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
I wrote my report yesterday.

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
Great! Thanks! Now I can write my report.

00:00.000 --> 00:04.360
Could it be your town?

00:04.360 --> 00:08.360
Joe is 15 and lives in Parkville.

00:08.360 --> 00:13.480
When Joe's grandparents first came to Parkville, it was a quiet village.

00:13.480 --> 00:18.020
They had a small house close to fields and hills.

00:18.020 --> 00:23.440
Parkville was near Arnwick, a city with 200,000 people.

00:23.440 --> 00:29.400
People from Parkville moved to Arnwick to find jobs and they needed places to live.

00:29.400 --> 00:35.040
And however, it was expensive to live in the city centre, so the government built flats

00:35.040 --> 00:37.360
outside the centre.

00:37.360 --> 00:44.840
Soon Parkville became part of Arnwick and Arnwick became a city with over a million people.

00:44.840 --> 00:47.840
Joe's family lives in one of those flats.

00:47.840 --> 00:52.480
It is very crowded and rubbish is also a problem.

00:52.480 --> 00:58.560
The small local school in Parkville closed down five years ago, so Joe now has to go to

00:58.560 --> 01:02.800
a school in Arnwick with 2,000 pupils.

01:02.800 --> 01:05.720
It takes an hour to get there by bus.

01:05.720 --> 01:09.520
There is a lot of traffic and pollution.

01:09.520 --> 01:14.920
It is clear that Arnwick needs more schools, buses and hospitals.

01:14.920 --> 01:20.120
It needs fresh air, clean water and better public services.

01:20.120 --> 01:23.920
It also needs more police to protect its people.

01:23.920 --> 01:27.400
But to do all these things, it needs more money.

01:27.720 --> 01:31.880
However, can money help solve all these problems?

01:31.880 --> 01:34.800
Do we need more big cities like this?

01:34.800 --> 01:41.640
In fact, this is just a story, but it describes what is happening all over the world.

01:41.640 --> 01:43.440
Could it be your town someday?

Joining car clubs is a good way to get around in cities. There are many car clubs in the

00:07.160 --> 00:14.440
US. You can use a car when you want to and it's cheaper than having a personal car.

00:14.440 --> 00:20.760
You only pay for the car when you drive it. You don't always use the car because sometimes

00:20.760 --> 00:28.040
you can take a bus or walk or ride a bike. This is healthier for the city as there will

00:28.040 --> 00:32.160
be fewer cars on the road. It is also healthier for you.

00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Traveling fast or traveling slow?

00:10.000 --> 00:13.400
Which is the fastest way to go?

00:13.400 --> 00:16.720
Over the land or over the seas?

00:16.720 --> 00:18.240
Which is the fastest?

00:18.240 --> 00:23.160
Tell me please, running on two legs over the ground.

00:23.160 --> 00:26.680
Alrighty my bicycle wheels going round.

00:26.680 --> 00:29.760
Galloping fast on a galloping horse.

00:29.760 --> 00:33.120
As faster than on my bike of course.

00:33.120 --> 00:36.400
But if you have to travel afar,

00:36.400 --> 00:39.760
you're faster again in a motor car.

00:39.760 --> 00:43.120
I'm very much faster when riding a train.

00:43.120 --> 00:46.640
But fastest off all in an aeroplane.

00:46.640 --> 00:49.960
Flying so high right up in the sky.

00:49.960 --> 00:53.320
Looking at all their clouds go by.

00:53.320 --> 00:56.400
Faster than bicycle car or train.

00:56.400 --> 00:59.880
The fastest off all is an aeroplane.

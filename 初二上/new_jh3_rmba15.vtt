One of my favourite films is Peter Pan. It is a very popular story with children and

00:07.200 --> 00:15.000
their parents. The story is about Peter Pan. Peter lives on the island of Neverland. He

00:15.000 --> 00:22.320
believes in magic and he never wants to grow up. One day he meets some children in London

00:22.320 --> 00:28.280
and they decide to go to the island with him. They have a wonderful time there, but there's

00:28.280 --> 00:34.880
danger too, because they meet Captain Hook, a very bad man.

00:34.880 --> 00:40.920
Near the end of the film, Peter Pan throws Captain Hook over the side of a ship, the

00:40.920 --> 00:48.840
children cheer loudly. But in the end Wendy misses her family and is worried about getting

00:48.840 --> 00:57.920
back, so she and her brothers leave Peter Pan and go back home. It's a fantastic film,

00:57.920 --> 01:01.800
exciting and very funny. See it if you can.

Good afternoon. It's 3 o'clock and you're listening to Radio Beijing with the latest news

00:08.680 --> 00:14.200
from China and around the world. I'm Zhongli.

00:14.200 --> 00:19.640
The president of Russia arrived in Beijing today for a three-day visit to China.

00:19.640 --> 00:27.080
Now for sports and we're going over to Wanglin for the latest report on the football match

00:27.080 --> 00:33.720
between China and England. Wanglin, can you tell us what the score is?

00:33.720 --> 00:42.760
Yes, at the moment the score is China 2, England 1. China is winning but there is still

00:42.760 --> 00:48.120
half an hour to go. Back to you, Zhongli.

00:48.120 --> 00:52.320

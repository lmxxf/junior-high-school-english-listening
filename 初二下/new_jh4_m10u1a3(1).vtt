Hi everybody, I'm the news director at Radio Beijing.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
Thank you for showing us around.

00:08.000 --> 00:13.000
No problem. Now, come this way.

00:13.000 --> 00:19.000
Look at the red light. When it's on, it means we're on air.

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
And we should avoid making any noise in the background.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
Okay.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
This is the newsroom.

00:28.000 --> 00:35.000
We collect the latest national and international news and write reports here.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
It gets crazy in here just before the program begins.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
How can I become a presenter?

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
I think you need to speak English really well.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
So keep studying.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
And I hope that you can join us one day.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
What about the sports news?

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
That's over there.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
And it is where we do interviews with the big sports stars.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
Let's watch the presenter.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Remember what I said.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
We need to keep quiet if the red light is on.

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
Finally, we've just heard that Germany has won the football match.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
2-1 against England.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Hey, that's great news.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
No, it's awful news.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
Shhh.

01:25.000 --> 01:30.000
And that's the end of the 6 o'clock news.

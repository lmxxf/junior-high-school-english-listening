00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Radio times.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.200
How old are you?

00:06.200 --> 00:09.000
The radio manager looked down at me.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.400
15, I said.

00:12.400 --> 00:15.840
And you want a job in radio?

00:15.840 --> 00:17.680
Shouldn't you be at school?

00:17.680 --> 00:19.720
He asked.

00:19.720 --> 00:21.680
How could I explain?

00:21.680 --> 00:23.520
I have always loved the radio.

00:23.520 --> 00:29.400
I still remember when I was four years old I sat close to the radio in the living room,

00:29.400 --> 00:34.920
listening to my favourite programmes and to the voices of my favourite presenters.

00:34.920 --> 00:41.160
It seemed that they were speaking not to lots of listeners, but to me in person.

00:41.160 --> 00:47.120
At the age of nine I asked for part-time jobs in small radio stations.

00:47.120 --> 00:51.200
As I grew older my interest in radio grew.

00:51.200 --> 00:54.560
One day I learnt about internet radio.

00:54.560 --> 01:00.320
Once a week I played my favourite music from my father's computer, talked about life

01:00.320 --> 01:04.560
at school and hoped someone might be listening.

01:04.560 --> 01:09.040
Soon my friends at school started to listen.

01:09.040 --> 01:11.440
And then they wanted to help.

01:11.440 --> 01:17.920
We prepared a programme once a week doing research on articles about music, sports news,

01:17.920 --> 01:20.320
jokes and the weather report.

01:20.320 --> 01:23.240
I did this by looking out of the window.

01:23.800 --> 01:26.760
OK, come with me.

01:26.760 --> 01:30.760
The manager said, I sat down in the studio.

01:30.760 --> 01:34.440
He was in another room behind a glass wall.

01:34.440 --> 01:39.360
OK, let's do a sound check.

01:39.360 --> 01:42.640
Just tell me what you had for breakfast.

01:42.640 --> 01:47.720
All radio presenters need to answer the same question before they begin work.

01:47.720 --> 01:51.160
The purpose is to check the sound level.

01:51.160 --> 01:54.680
I had eggs, fruit and some milk.

01:54.680 --> 01:57.600
OK, that's great.

01:57.600 --> 02:03.720
The man behind the glass said, this was how my first real job in radio began.

Hello everyone, I'm Kate. My day starts at about 10am with a run in the park. I run for about an hour.

00:12.000 --> 00:23.000
At 11am, I listen to the latest news on the radio. Then I meet my team and we prepare the program.

00:23.000 --> 00:30.000
My program starts at 4pm and finishes at 7.30pm.

00:30.000 --> 00:38.000
Before I begin, I think about my listeners. I imagine that I am talking to them in person.

00:38.000 --> 00:45.000
That makes my radio show feel personal. People seem to like that.

00:45.000 --> 00:52.000
In the first part of the show, I interview my guests. Then the news reader comes in.

00:52.000 --> 01:01.000
The news takes about 5 minutes. After the news is the weather report and then the phone in.

01:01.000 --> 01:08.000
That's when listeners phone the station and talk to me. It's my favourite part of the program.

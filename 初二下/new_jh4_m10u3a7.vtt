It's really nice of you to agree to talk to us, Bernard. I know you're very busy.

00:06.360 --> 00:13.040
I'm very happy to talk to you. I enjoyed my time at school. It was a good school.

00:13.040 --> 00:17.040
It still is. I'm very happy there.

00:17.040 --> 00:21.560
So, you present programs for the school radio station?

00:21.560 --> 00:29.040
Yes. And we want you to tell us about your work as a presenter for a popular radio program.

00:29.040 --> 00:33.040
We want to know how you've become so successful.

00:33.040 --> 00:38.600
Well, to become successful, you need to work hard, you know.

00:38.600 --> 00:45.080
And I've always worked very hard. It's also important to love your job.

00:45.080 --> 00:49.600
And I've loved radio since I was quite young.

00:49.600 --> 00:54.600
How old were you when you decided you wanted to work in radio?

00:54.920 --> 01:01.200
I started presenting music shows for the school radio when I was 15.

01:01.200 --> 01:09.200
I became the youngest presenter of a popular national teenage radio show when I was 17.

01:09.200 --> 01:16.840
And then, when I went to university, I worked on the university radio station in my free time.

01:16.840 --> 01:23.120
After that, it was easy to get a job with a local radio station in a small town.

01:23.160 --> 01:30.360
And after about two years, a national radio station asked me to work for them.

01:30.360 --> 01:34.480
I've worked for them for four years now.

01:34.480 --> 01:37.920
It sounds very easy when you talk about it.

01:37.920 --> 01:41.120
It was quite easy, really.

01:41.120 --> 01:46.640
If you're very interested in something, you usually want to be good at it.

01:46.640 --> 01:51.680
You'll keep on practising and you'll be successful.

01:51.680 --> 01:54.720
Thanks. I'll remember that.

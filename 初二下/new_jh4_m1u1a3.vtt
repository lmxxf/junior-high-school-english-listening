Mmm. What a delicious smell. Your pizza looks so nice.

00:06.240 --> 00:09.920
Thanks. Would you like to try, son?

00:09.920 --> 00:15.480
Yes, please. It looks lovely. It smells delicious and...

00:15.480 --> 00:21.560
Mmm. It tastes good. What's that on top?

00:21.560 --> 00:26.360
Oh, that's cheese. Do you want to try a piece?

00:26.600 --> 00:31.560
Err. No, thanks. I'm afraid I don't like cheese.

00:31.560 --> 00:38.600
It doesn't smell fresh. It smells too strong and it tastes a bit sour.

00:38.600 --> 00:43.160
Well, my chocolate cookies are done now. Have a try.

00:43.160 --> 00:51.560
Thanks. They taste really sweet and they feel soft in the middle.

00:51.560 --> 00:56.200
Are you cooking lots of different things? You look very busy.

00:56.280 --> 01:04.680
Yes, I am. There's some pizza and some cookies and now I'm making an apple pie and a cake.

01:04.680 --> 01:10.040
Apple pie sounds nice. I have a sweet tooth, you know.

01:10.040 --> 01:16.200
Shall I get the sugar? Yes, please. Oh, are you sure that sugar?

01:16.200 --> 01:22.280
Taste it first. It might be salt. No, it's okay.

01:22.280 --> 01:29.320
It tastes sweet. It's sugar. What's this? It tastes sweet too.

01:29.320 --> 01:36.280
That's strawberry jam for the cake. Good. Everything tastes so sweet.

01:36.280 --> 01:38.840
It's my lucky day.

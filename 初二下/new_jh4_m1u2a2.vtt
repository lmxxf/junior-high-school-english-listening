Hi Ling Ling!

00:03.680 --> 00:06.320
Thanks for your last message.

00:06.320 --> 00:12.240
It was great to hear from you and I can't wait to meet you.

00:12.240 --> 00:17.760
I hope you will know me from my photo when I arrive at the airport.

00:17.760 --> 00:23.760
I'm quite tall with short fair hair and I wear glasses.

00:23.760 --> 00:30.600
I'll wear jeans and a t-shirt for the journey, but I'll also carry my warm coat.

00:30.600 --> 00:32.840
I've got your photo.

00:32.840 --> 00:37.680
You look very pretty, I'm sure we'll find each other.

00:37.680 --> 00:40.480
Thanks for telling me about your hobbies.

00:40.480 --> 00:43.120
You sound just like me.

00:43.120 --> 00:48.640
I spend a lot of time playing classical music with my friends at school, but I also like

00:48.640 --> 00:50.280
dance music.

00:50.280 --> 00:52.920
I love dancing.

00:52.920 --> 00:57.800
I enjoy sports as well, especially tennis.

00:57.800 --> 01:01.320
My brother is in the school tennis team.

01:01.320 --> 01:04.200
I'm very proud of him.

01:04.200 --> 01:08.240
He's good at everything, but I'm not.

01:08.240 --> 01:13.240
Sometimes I get bad marks at school and I feel sad.

01:13.240 --> 01:16.120
I should work harder.

01:16.120 --> 01:20.440
You asked me, how do you feel about coming to China?

01:20.840 --> 01:27.520
Well, I often feel a bit sad at first when I leave my mum and dad for a few days.

01:27.520 --> 01:31.560
And I'm quite shy when I'm with strangers.

01:31.560 --> 01:37.720
I feel nervous when I speak Chinese, but I'll be fine in a few days.

01:37.720 --> 01:42.520
I'm always sorry when I don't know how to do things in the right way, so please help

01:42.520 --> 01:45.320
me when I'm with you in China.

01:45.320 --> 01:49.160
Oh, I'm afraid of flying too.

01:49.160 --> 01:53.960
I can't tell you how excited I am about going to China.

01:53.960 --> 01:55.760
See you next week.

01:55.760 --> 01:56.600
Love Sally.

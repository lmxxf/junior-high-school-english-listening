00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Let's go home. I don't like this party.

00:05.000 --> 00:11.000
Why? I'm having a great time. The music is good, isn't it?

00:11.000 --> 00:17.000
Well, I think it's terrible. It's too loud and it sounds like noise.

00:17.000 --> 00:22.000
Not music. And the room is too hot for dancing anyway.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
Why don't you have something to eat?

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
I don't like party food. It has too much salt.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
How about a drink then?

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
I tried some of the cola that it's too cold.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
Well, you can talk to some people. Then you might feel happier.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
The people aren't very friendly. Nobody is talking to me at all.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.000
Well, I'm not surprised really. Maybe everyone is afraid of talking to you.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
You look so angry.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
Maybe you're right. I should try to be a bit friendly to myself.

Hi Ling Ling, what are you doing?

00:03.840 --> 00:06.600
I'm entering a competition.

00:06.600 --> 00:08.320
What kind of competition?

00:08.320 --> 00:10.600
A speaking competition.

00:10.600 --> 00:11.600
Great.

00:11.600 --> 00:14.400
It will help you improve your speaking.

00:14.400 --> 00:16.680
And maybe you will win a prize.

00:16.680 --> 00:20.480
The first prize is my dream holiday.

00:20.480 --> 00:23.000
Have you ever won any prizes before?

00:23.000 --> 00:25.080
No, I haven't.

00:25.080 --> 00:28.240
I've always wanted to go on a dream holiday.

00:28.240 --> 00:30.160
But I can't afford it.

00:30.160 --> 00:32.280
The plane ticket's too expensive.

00:32.280 --> 00:34.640
Well, good luck.

00:34.640 --> 00:40.520
I've also entered lots of speaking competitions, but haven't won any prizes.

00:40.520 --> 00:42.720
I've stopped trying now.

00:42.720 --> 00:44.040
That's a pity.

00:44.040 --> 00:47.960
Have you ever thought about other kinds of competitions?

00:47.960 --> 00:48.960
What do you mean?

00:48.960 --> 00:55.880
Look, here's a writing competition around the world in 80 days.

00:55.880 --> 01:01.080
To win it, you need to write a short story about a place you visited.

01:01.080 --> 01:04.840
That sounds wonderful, but I haven't travelled much.

01:04.840 --> 01:06.520
How can I write about it?

01:06.520 --> 01:08.040
Don't worry.

01:08.040 --> 01:09.960
It doesn't need to be true.

01:09.960 --> 01:11.720
You can make it up.

01:11.720 --> 01:12.720
You're right.

01:12.720 --> 01:13.720
I'll try.

01:13.720 --> 01:14.720
I hope I will win.

01:14.720 --> 01:17.960
Then I will invite you to come with me.

01:17.960 --> 01:18.960
Sorry.

01:18.960 --> 01:24.320
The first prize is only the book called around the world in 80 days.

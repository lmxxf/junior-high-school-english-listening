Mike Robinson is a 15-year-old American boy and his sister Claire is 14.

00:07.440 --> 00:15.840
At the moment, Mike and Claire are in Cairo in Egypt, one of the biggest and busiest cities in Africa.

00:15.840 --> 00:19.840
They moved here with their parents two years ago.

00:19.840 --> 00:24.640
Their father, Peter, works for a very big company.

00:25.360 --> 00:31.520
The company has offices in many countries and it has sent Peter to work in Germany,

00:31.520 --> 00:38.080
France and China before. Peter usually stays in a country for about two years.

00:39.200 --> 00:44.240
Then the company moves him again. His family always goes with him.

00:46.720 --> 00:52.400
The Robinson's love seeing the world. They have been to many interesting places.

00:53.360 --> 00:56.800
For example, in Egypt they have seen the pyramids,

00:57.520 --> 01:04.240
travelled on a boat on the Nile River and visited the palaces and towers of ancient kings and queens.

01:06.400 --> 01:11.280
Mike and Claire have also begun to learn the language of the country, Arabic.

01:12.800 --> 01:19.440
This language is different from English in many ways and they find it hard to spell and pronounce

01:19.440 --> 01:28.720
the words. However, they still enjoy learning it. So far, they have learnt to speak German,

01:29.520 --> 01:36.240
French, Chinese and Arabic. Sometimes they mix the languages.

01:37.440 --> 01:39.680
It's really fun. said Claire.

01:41.280 --> 01:47.680
The Robinson's are moving again. The company has asked Peter to work back in the US.

01:48.240 --> 01:54.720
Mike and Claire are happy about this. They have friends all over the world,

01:54.720 --> 02:01.280
but they also miss their friends in the US. They are counting down the days.

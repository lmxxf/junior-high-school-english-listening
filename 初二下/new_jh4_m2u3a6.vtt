Today, we are talking to Winnie, Diana and Bob about their travel experiences. Welcome,

00:09.760 --> 00:15.160
everyone. Winnie, you've traveled a lot, haven't you?

00:15.160 --> 00:22.680
Yes, I've been all over China. I've also been to the US. In fact, I've flown to the

00:22.680 --> 00:31.000
US three times. What about you, Diana? Have you been to the US or China?

00:31.000 --> 00:38.080
I've never been to the US, but I've been to China many times. I've traveled all over

00:38.080 --> 00:44.840
South China by train. It was fantastic. I'd like to go there again and look around the

00:44.840 --> 00:51.080
country some more. And you, Bob? Where have you been?

00:51.080 --> 00:59.640
Well, I live in France. I've been all over Europe, but I've never been to Africa or Asia.

00:59.640 --> 01:01.800
I've never been to the US either.

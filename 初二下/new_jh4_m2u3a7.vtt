Today, we are talking to Winnie, Diana and Bob about their travel experiences. Welcome, everyone. Winnie, you've traveled a lot, haven't you?

00:15.000 --> 00:25.000
Yes, I've been all over China. I've also been to the US. In fact, I've flown to the US three times.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.000
What about you, Diana? Have you been to the US or China?

00:31.000 --> 00:42.000
I've never been to the US, but I've been to China many times. I've travelled all over South China by train. It was fantastic.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
I'd like to go there again and look around the country some more.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
And you, Bob? Where have you been?

00:50.000 --> 01:02.000
Well, I live in France. I've been all over Europe, but I've never been to Africa or Asia. I've never been to the US either.

I'm really interested in the space trip from the Earth to Mars. It's so exciting. Has the

00:07.440 --> 00:14.560
spaceship landed yet? I don't know. Let's listen to the news on the radio and find out.

00:16.560 --> 00:23.920
We've just had some news about the trip to Mars. The spaceship has reached Mars after a journey

00:23.920 --> 00:30.720
of eight months. It hasn't sent back any messages yet, but scientists are waiting.

00:32.000 --> 00:40.640
As we know, there isn't any life on the moon, but scientists hope to find life on Mars and other planets.

Hi Tony, what are you up to?

00:03.580 --> 00:04.980
Hi darling.

00:04.980 --> 00:10.080
I've just made a model spaceship for our school project.

00:10.080 --> 00:14.920
I haven't started yet because I'm not sure how to make it.

00:14.920 --> 00:16.320
Can you help me?

00:16.320 --> 00:18.800
Sure, no problem.

00:18.800 --> 00:21.560
Have you heard the latest news?

00:21.560 --> 00:24.620
Scientists have sent a spaceship to Mars.

00:24.620 --> 00:27.640
The journey has taken several months.

00:27.640 --> 00:29.200
Has it arrived yet?

00:29.200 --> 00:32.240
Yes, it has arrived already.

00:32.240 --> 00:34.720
That's why it's on the news.

00:34.720 --> 00:37.440
So have they discovered life on Mars?

00:37.440 --> 00:40.760
No, they haven't yet.

00:40.760 --> 00:43.240
Are there any astronauts in the spaceship?

00:43.240 --> 00:45.240
No, they're aren't.

00:45.240 --> 00:47.440
Why?

00:47.440 --> 00:49.720
Astronauts have already been to the Moon.

00:49.720 --> 00:56.320
Yes, but no one has been to Mars yet because Mars is very far away, much farther than

00:56.320 --> 00:57.960
the Moon.

00:57.960 --> 01:03.680
Scientists have worked hard in order to send astronauts to Mars one day.

01:03.680 --> 01:05.680
That's interesting.

01:05.680 --> 01:08.840
How can I get information on space travel?

01:08.840 --> 01:12.240
You can go online to search for the information.

01:12.240 --> 01:14.040
I will.

01:14.040 --> 01:14.640
Thank you Tony.

Hi Tony, what are you up to?

00:03.080 --> 00:04.680
Hi darling.

00:04.680 --> 00:09.520
I've just made a model spaceship for our school project.

00:09.520 --> 00:14.280
I haven't started yet because I'm not sure how to make it.

00:14.280 --> 00:15.760
Can you help me?

00:15.760 --> 00:18.080
Sure, no problem.

00:18.080 --> 00:20.280
Have you heard the latest news?

00:20.280 --> 00:24.000
Scientists have sent a spaceship to Mars.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.840
The journey has taken several months.

00:26.840 --> 00:28.520
Has it arrived yet?

00:28.680 --> 00:31.640
Yes, it has arrived already.

00:31.640 --> 00:34.160
That's why it's on the news.

00:34.160 --> 00:36.920
So have they discovered life on Mars?

00:36.920 --> 00:40.160
No, they haven't yet.

00:40.160 --> 00:42.720
Are there any astronauts in the spaceship?

00:42.720 --> 00:44.960
No, they're aren't.

00:44.960 --> 00:45.960
What?

00:45.960 --> 00:49.600
Not astronauts have already been to the Moon.

00:49.600 --> 00:52.520
Yes, but no one has been to Mars yet,

00:52.520 --> 00:57.440
because Mars is very far away, much farther than the Moon.

00:57.440 --> 01:03.280
Lots of scientists are working hard in order to send astronauts to Mars one day.

01:03.280 --> 01:05.480
That's interesting.

01:05.480 --> 01:08.600
How can I get information on space travel?

01:08.600 --> 01:12.000
You can go online to search the information.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.560
I will.

01:13.560 --> 01:14.560
Thank you Tony.

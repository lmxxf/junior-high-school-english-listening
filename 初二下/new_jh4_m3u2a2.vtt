00:00.000 --> 00:06.400
Scientists think that there has been life on the earth for hundreds of millions of years.

00:06.400 --> 00:12.400
However, we have not found life on any other planets yet.

00:12.400 --> 00:16.600
The earth is a planet and it goes around the sun.

00:16.600 --> 00:20.560
Seven other planets also go around the sun.

00:20.560 --> 00:26.040
None of them has an environment like that of the earth, so scientists do not think they

00:26.040 --> 00:28.760
will find life on them.

00:28.760 --> 00:34.960
The sun and its planets are called the solar system, and our solar system is a small

00:34.960 --> 00:42.720
part of a much larger group of stars and planets called the galaxy or the Milky Way.

00:42.720 --> 00:50.560
There are billions of stars in the galaxy, and our sun is only one of them.

00:50.560 --> 00:55.200
Scientists have also discovered many other galaxies in the universe.

00:55.200 --> 01:02.000
They are very far away, and their light has to travel for many years to reach us.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.640
So how large is the universe?

01:05.640 --> 01:09.280
It is impossible to imagine.

01:09.280 --> 01:14.280
Scientists have sent spaceships to the planet Mars to take photos.

01:14.280 --> 01:18.960
They have even sent spaceships to travel outside the solar system.

01:19.040 --> 01:25.240
However, no spaceship has travelled far enough to reach other stars in our galaxy.

01:25.240 --> 01:28.640
Scientists have always asked the questions,

01:28.640 --> 01:31.600
with so many stars in the universe,

01:31.600 --> 01:36.560
are we alone or is there life out there in space?

01:36.560 --> 01:40.000
Have there been visitors to the earth from other planets?

01:40.000 --> 01:43.920
Why has no one communicated with us?

01:43.920 --> 01:48.160
We do not know the answers yet.

Today's programme is about space travel. I'm talking to an astronaut from CNSA.

00:08.000 --> 00:16.000
Hello! We're interested to hear about your experiences in space. When did you join CNSA?

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Six years ago.

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
And how many times have you flown in a spaceship?

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
Two times.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
How did you feel when you were in the spaceship?

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
I enjoyed it. It was very exciting.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
Have you worked on the space station?

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
Yes, I have. I've already been there twice.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
Have you seen the Earth from the space station?

00:43.000 --> 00:49.000
Yes, I have. It's very blue and very beautiful.

00:49.000 --> 00:54.000
How wonderful. How did you feel when you saw it?

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
I was so happy. I wanted to cry.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.000
I'm sure. Tell me, why did you decide to become an astronaut?

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
I've always been interested in space. It's so exciting.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
Do you think there's life on other planets?

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
Yes, I do. The universe is so big.

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
There are so many galaxies and so many solar systems.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
But we haven't found anything yet.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
We've only just begun to look. Give us time.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
Another hundred years maybe.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
Well, thank you for talking to us. It's been great to talk to you.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Thank you.

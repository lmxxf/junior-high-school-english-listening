Hi Betty. Hi, darling. You don't look very well. What's the matter with you?

00:08.000 --> 00:18.000
I've got a stomach ache and a headache. Have you seen a doctor? No, I haven't.

00:18.000 --> 00:26.000
You should go and see one. Okay. You don't look very well either Betty.

00:26.000 --> 00:34.000
What's the matter with you? Have you got a fever? Yes, I've got a temperature and a cough.

00:34.000 --> 00:41.000
You should see a doctor too. I've seen a doctor. I saw a doctor this morning.

00:41.000 --> 00:47.000
Ah! What's the matter? I've got a toothache as well.

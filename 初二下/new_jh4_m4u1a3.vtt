00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
How can I help you?

00:03.000 --> 00:09.000
I feel ill. I've got a stomach ache and my head hurts.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
How long have you been like this?

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
Since Friday. I've been ill for about three days.

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
I see. Have you caught a cold?

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
I don't think so.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
Let me take your temperature.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
Hmm. There's no fever.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
What kind of food do you eat?

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
Usually fast food.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
Do you have breakfast?

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
No. Not usually.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
That's the problem.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
Fast food and no breakfast.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
That's why you've got a stomach ache.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
What about the headache?

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
Do you do any exercise?

00:57.000 --> 01:03.000
Not really. I haven't done much exercise since I got my computer last year.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
You spend too much time in front of the computer.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
It can be very harmful to your health.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
Okay. So what should I do?

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
Well, don't worry. It's not serious.

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
First, stop eating fast food and have breakfast every day.

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
Second, get some exercise, such as running.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
And I'll give you some medicine.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
Take it three times a day.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
Thank you, doctor.

00:00.000 --> 00:04.400
Healthy living.

00:04.400 --> 00:12.360
I was not feeling very well, so the doctor checked my heart and said I needed more exercise.

00:12.360 --> 00:17.920
I have never been very active and I do not like sports.

00:17.920 --> 00:25.040
I have always wanted a pet, so my parents gave me a dog for my birthday.

00:25.040 --> 00:29.880
Now I get exercise by taking him for a walk every day.

00:29.880 --> 00:35.360
I have had him for three months now and I feel really healthy.

00:35.360 --> 00:37.640
Anna.

00:37.640 --> 00:44.440
Our teacher decided to start a girls football team and I thought, what a great idea!

00:44.440 --> 00:47.280
I was the first member of the team.

00:47.280 --> 00:52.200
We have played football for a year now and we all feel very fit.

00:52.200 --> 00:57.720
Our teacher is the coach and she also takes part in the training with us.

00:57.720 --> 01:00.280
She is in excellent condition too.

01:00.280 --> 01:02.600
One way.

01:02.600 --> 01:07.400
For the last few years I went to work on the underground.

01:07.400 --> 01:14.080
When I got to work I always felt very sleepy and I was not happy.

01:14.080 --> 01:17.240
I bought a bike in January.

01:17.240 --> 01:20.720
Since then it has become part of my life.

01:20.720 --> 01:23.920
Now I ride to work every day.

01:23.920 --> 01:26.320
It is my daily exercise.

01:26.320 --> 01:30.920
I arrive at work with a smile on my face.

01:30.920 --> 01:32.800
Thomas.

01:32.800 --> 01:39.440
I was weak after a long illness, so I wanted to exercise more.

01:39.440 --> 01:44.840
Then a friend suggested, why don't we go for a run before school?

01:44.840 --> 01:48.040
So we started running a week ago.

01:48.040 --> 01:53.240
But I do not enjoy running and when I get to school I feel awful.

01:53.240 --> 01:57.520
My legs hurt and I am hot all over.

01:57.520 --> 02:00.360
Perhaps I am too weak to do any exercise.

02:00.360 --> 02:02.360
What do you think?

02:02.360 --> 02:02.680
Richard.

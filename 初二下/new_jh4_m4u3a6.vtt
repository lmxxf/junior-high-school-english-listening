00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
What can I do?

00:03.000 --> 00:08.000
I would like to take more exercise, but I have not found a favourite sport.

00:08.000 --> 00:15.000
The coach has not chosen me to play in the football team because I am not fit and I am not a good player.

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
I went running in the park to get fit, but I felt lonely and sad.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
What can I do?

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
Alan.

00:26.000 --> 00:37.000
I went to school by bus in the past and I did not feel fit, so last month I decided to take more exercise and started walking to school.

00:37.000 --> 00:44.000
I have walked to school for three weeks now. I am getting a lot fitter and I feel healthier.

00:44.000 --> 00:52.000
The problem is all my friends take the bus to school and I do not have anyone to talk with on the way.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
What can I do? Barbara.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
I love playing computer games with my friends.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
I also watch TV and eat fast food.

01:03.000 --> 01:08.000
I know it is not healthy and sometimes I get a stomach ache.

01:08.000 --> 01:15.000
The problem is I do not know how to stop and become fitter and healthier.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
I do not want to spend all my life sitting in a chair.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
What can I do?

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
John.

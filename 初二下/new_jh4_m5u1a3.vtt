Daming, we've finished our homework. It's time to watch a cartoon. Good idea, Tony.

00:07.000 --> 00:14.480
Let's watch Superman. We watched Superman yesterday. Why don't we watch Spider-Man? It's

00:14.480 --> 00:21.880
more modern. I think Superman is better. He's stronger than Spider-Man. He can fly through

00:21.880 --> 00:28.120
the sky and fight bad people. Spider-Man can't fly, but he climbs up buildings with his

00:28.120 --> 00:33.120
hands and feet. That's cool. I want to be someone like him.

00:33.120 --> 00:42.320
Well, Superman is brave. He keeps fighting bad people. That's a real hero. I don't think

00:42.320 --> 00:43.320
we agree.

00:43.320 --> 00:51.560
Alright. Let's watch Tom and Jerry then. Yeah. I like humorous cartoons. Tom and Jerry

00:51.560 --> 00:58.840
are very funny. I can't help laughing when I watch them. Yes. Jerry is too smart for

00:58.840 --> 01:06.120
Tom. The cute mouse always beats the cat. They fight a lot, but they really love each other.

01:06.120 --> 01:10.640
Sometimes they protect each other and work together. I think there's a lesson there.

Cartoon Heroes Nemo is a cute orange and white fish,

00:08.320 --> 00:16.040
and Shrek is an ugly green men. They look very different, but both of them have won the

00:16.040 --> 00:23.760
hearts of young people all over the world. The pictures of these popular cartoon heroes

00:23.760 --> 00:32.600
are everywhere, on office desks, school bags and computer screens. There are also some

00:32.600 --> 00:40.780
older cartoon favourites, for example the Monkey King. He is the hero of a story called

00:40.780 --> 00:49.440
Havok in Heaven. He leads a group of monkeys against the Emperor of Heaven and his men.

00:49.440 --> 00:57.560
He is brave, clever and humorous. Parents and children laugh together as the Monkey King

00:57.560 --> 01:04.960
makes a terrible mess in Heaven. They always expect to see more Monkey King cartoons.

01:04.960 --> 01:15.800
Tintin is another favourite cartoon hero. He has been popular for over 80 years, ever since

01:15.800 --> 01:26.960
the artist Herjet invented him in 1929. Tintin has red hair and a small white dog. He works

01:26.960 --> 01:36.440
for a newspaper and has lots of exciting experiences. Fans have bought about 200 million copies of

01:36.440 --> 01:46.680
Tintin's stories in more than 50 languages. Tintin appeared in China in the 1980s. Many Chinese

01:46.680 --> 01:56.080
still collect these black and white Tintin books. Finally, Snoopy, a cute dog, celebrated his

01:56.080 --> 02:06.360
60th birthday in 2010. Snoopy lives in his own private world and finds real life hard to understand.

02:06.360 --> 02:16.400
Charles Schultz created Snoopy and his friends and drew the cartoons to satisfy older people as well as children.

00:00.000 --> 00:03.600
I think this is really funny.

00:03.600 --> 00:06.360
Why? I don't get the joke.

00:06.360 --> 00:11.680
Look, in the first picture, there's a man running away from a policeman.

00:11.680 --> 00:15.400
But why is he running away? I don't understand.

00:15.400 --> 00:20.400
Well, he's done something wrong. The policeman wants to catch him.

00:20.400 --> 00:24.400
I see. And then the man runs into the lift.

00:24.400 --> 00:29.000
Yes. And this is the funny bit. It's really clever.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.200
The policeman could catch the man in the lift, but he doesn't.

00:33.200 --> 00:37.200
They both just stand there waiting for the lift to stop.

00:37.200 --> 00:41.200
Now I get it. Yes, it is funny.

00:41.200 --> 00:47.800
Yes. And as we see in the last picture, the policeman is still trying to catch the man.

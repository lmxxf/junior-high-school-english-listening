00:00.000 --> 00:04.600
The first cartoons appeared in newspapers.

00:04.600 --> 00:08.320
They told stories using pictures.

00:08.320 --> 00:15.720
The first photographed cartoon film in 1906 was about humorous faces.

00:15.720 --> 00:21.720
In the film, an artist drew pictures of two faces on a blackboard.

00:21.720 --> 00:24.000
The faces came to life.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.160
They smiled and a small dog jumped through a ring.

00:29.160 --> 00:32.920
There were lots of animals in early cartoons.

00:32.920 --> 00:39.200
One famous early cartoon character was Felix the Cat.

00:39.200 --> 00:44.160
Walt Disney started to make films in the 1920s.

00:44.160 --> 00:50.280
Some of his earliest films were about a famous story, Alice in Wonderland.

00:50.280 --> 00:56.400
But in Disney's films, it was called Alice in Cartoonland.

00:56.400 --> 01:01.840
Walt Disney's most famous cartoon character was Mickey Mouse.

01:01.840 --> 01:08.480
He appeared in 1928, first in a black and white film without sound.

01:08.480 --> 01:15.360
Then very soon after that, in a talking film and later in colour.

01:15.360 --> 01:22.520
A Mickey Mouse film was the first cartoon film with sound to become really popular.

01:22.520 --> 01:30.680
Today, over a hundred years later, cartoons are still popular with people of all ages.

01:30.680 --> 01:34.720
They will probably be popular for many more years in the future.

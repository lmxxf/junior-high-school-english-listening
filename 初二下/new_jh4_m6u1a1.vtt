Tony, can you tidy up your room please?

00:04.320 --> 00:07.680
OK Mum, I'll do it right away.

00:07.680 --> 00:11.840
You need to find a place to put all those toy cars.

00:11.840 --> 00:13.440
That's not easy.

00:13.440 --> 00:16.120
I've got so many toy cars now.

00:16.120 --> 00:18.360
Yes, you have.

00:18.360 --> 00:23.320
You know, your dad collected cars too when he was your age.

00:23.320 --> 00:25.680
He also collected stamps.

00:25.920 --> 00:29.360
Well, stamps are too expensive for me.

00:29.360 --> 00:32.240
But I've collected a lot of tickets.

00:32.240 --> 00:35.000
Did you collect anything when you were young Mum?

00:35.000 --> 00:38.600
Yes, I collected postcards and fans.

00:38.600 --> 00:40.880
You know Chinese fans.

00:40.880 --> 00:41.880
I see.

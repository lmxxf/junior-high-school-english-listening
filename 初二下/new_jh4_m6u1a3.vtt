Hi everyone, come in and find somewhere to sit down. Sorry it's a bit of a mess, I'll

00:07.120 --> 00:13.680
put the fans on the shelf. Let me have a look. You've got so many fans.

00:13.680 --> 00:21.200
Yes, about 60. Where did you get them? Most of them are presents. People often give

00:21.200 --> 00:27.080
me fans as presents because they know I like them. Do you collect anything?

00:27.240 --> 00:33.800
Yes, I collect coins and notes. You know, like British pounds and US dollars.

00:34.600 --> 00:42.760
Coins, they must be really valuable. Can I see them? Sure, I'll show you my stamps too.

00:42.760 --> 00:47.960
I've collected stamps from all over the world. I've got six or seven books of stamps.

00:48.920 --> 00:55.080
My hobby doesn't cost as much as yours. I collect tickets, bus tickets and train tickets.

00:55.800 --> 01:02.440
You can't do anything with all tickets. I know, but when I look at them, I remember some

01:02.440 --> 01:09.320
wonderful places. Right, their value isn't always important. People also collect things just

01:09.320 --> 01:19.320
to remember something important in their lives.

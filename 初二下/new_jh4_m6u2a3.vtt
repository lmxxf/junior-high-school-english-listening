David's hobbies

00:03.120 --> 00:12.560
Many students have hobbies such as reading, painting, growing vegetables and looking after animals.

00:12.560 --> 00:18.240
Some hobbies are relaxing and others are active.

00:18.240 --> 00:26.640
Hobbies can make you grow as a person, develop your interests and help you learn new skills.

00:27.040 --> 00:31.760
David Smith is a student and one of his hobbies is writing.

00:33.200 --> 00:38.320
During the summer of 2010 he spent four weeks at a summer camp.

00:39.840 --> 00:45.600
As well as the usual activities such as sailing and climbing, there was a writing class.

00:47.120 --> 00:52.640
The teacher was a writer and she asked us to talk about our lives and tell interesting stories.

00:53.280 --> 00:57.040
Then she encouraged us to write about our experiences at the camp.

00:58.320 --> 01:07.120
Back at school, David wrote a story about the life of a 16-year-old boy and it came out as a book in 2012.

01:08.720 --> 01:16.240
Many young people love his book and as a result David has become a successful young writer.

01:16.960 --> 01:24.720
David has been very lucky because his hobby has brought him pleasure and success.

01:26.240 --> 01:32.960
But writing is not his only hobby. He is also interested in many other things.

01:32.960 --> 01:37.200
I like playing volleyball too. Says David.

01:38.080 --> 01:42.000
I spend some of my free time playing volleyball for my school team.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.320
Maybe I'll write about my volleyball team in my future books.

00:00.000 --> 00:03.920
A fantastic hobby.

00:03.920 --> 00:11.600
A British boy has become one of the youngest people to sail alone across the Atlantic Ocean.

00:11.600 --> 00:16.920
Seb Clover has a fantastic and exciting hobby.

00:16.920 --> 00:18.720
Sailing.

00:18.720 --> 00:27.680
He sailed his 9.8 meter long boat, 5,000 kilometers from Tenerife to Antigua.

00:27.680 --> 00:30.120
15-year-old Seb said.

00:30.120 --> 00:34.640
Sometimes I was afraid, but I still enjoyed every moment.

00:34.640 --> 00:39.960
The best thing was seeing fish and other sea animals swimming close to the boat.

00:39.960 --> 00:44.240
He was also very happy to arrive in Antigua.

00:44.240 --> 00:47.400
You were busy all the time on the boat alone.

00:47.400 --> 00:52.160
It's difficult to cook something to eat on this kind of journey because you have to watch

00:52.160 --> 00:54.560
the sea all the time.

00:54.560 --> 00:58.360
Usually you eat something small and often.

00:58.360 --> 01:01.720
That way you don't have to stop working.

01:01.720 --> 01:04.400
The worst part of the journey?

01:04.400 --> 01:06.120
That's easy to answer.

01:06.120 --> 01:07.120
Said Seb.

01:07.120 --> 01:10.280
I ran out of chocolate.

01:10.280 --> 01:15.800
Seb has sailed boats since he was very young and started to get ready for this journey

01:15.800 --> 01:19.080
when he was only 12.

01:19.080 --> 01:20.280
Seb said.

01:20.280 --> 01:25.400
I enjoyed sailing alone, but I'm looking forward to going back to school now.

01:25.400 --> 01:28.360
Next time, I'd like to go sailing with my friends.

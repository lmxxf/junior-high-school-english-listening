Have you heard the news?

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
What news?

00:04.000 --> 00:09.000
Lingling and I are doing an English course in LA this summer.

00:09.000 --> 00:14.000
Oh really? That's great. How long will you stay in LA?

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
About four weeks. It's a good chance to practice my English.

00:19.000 --> 00:25.000
It sure is. But it's also quite expensive to stay in America for four weeks.

00:25.000 --> 00:33.000
We are going in a group of twenty and will all stay with different families so it won't cost so much.

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
That's good to hear. I hope you have a great time.

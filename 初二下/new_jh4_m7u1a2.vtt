Hi, Betty. I'm making a list of things for my trip. I like to get things ready earlier.

00:07.000 --> 00:15.500
Can you help me? Sure. How can I help? Well, it sounds crazy, but I don't know what to take.

00:15.500 --> 00:23.200
You should take notebooks, pens and a dictionary. Okay. What clothes should I take to L.A.?

00:23.200 --> 00:27.240
When are you leaving? And how long are you going to stay there?

00:27.240 --> 00:32.240
I'm leaving at the end of July, and I'm going to stay there for four weeks.

00:32.240 --> 00:38.240
Sure, it's so good. Or you can wear light trousers. It'll be sunny and hot there.

00:38.240 --> 00:42.740
I haven't got any sunglasses. I'll buy a pair there.

00:42.740 --> 00:48.740
That's a good idea. But remember, many things are more expensive in America.

00:48.740 --> 00:54.240
Have you got any American dollars? Yes, it's $200 enough.

00:54.240 --> 00:59.740
If you've already paid for the air tickets and for home's day, it should be okay.

00:59.740 --> 01:09.240
What else? Your bag mustn't weigh too much. You'd better ask the travel company about the total weight for all your bags.

01:09.240 --> 01:15.240
Oh, by the way, don't forget to take your passport. Okay, thank you.

01:15.240 --> 01:21.240
You're welcome. You'll have a great time. Please write to me and send me some photos.

01:21.240 --> 01:23.240
Yes, I will.

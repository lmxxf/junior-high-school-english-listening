Sorry, the Matan family is not a dome right now.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
Please leave a message.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
Hi Jane, it's Wong Fang.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
I'm at home with my American family.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
The mum and dad are really nice.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
What's your family in France like?

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
We've just finished lunch.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
The weather is really nice

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
and we are thinking about going to the beach this afternoon.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
One of the boys in the family plays beach volleyball

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
and his team is playing on the beach today.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
We'll stay there until six o'clock

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
and then we're going to a concert in the park.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
A French group is playing.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
They're called the music planet.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Have you heard of them?

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
My family says they're really good.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
The price of the tickets is only five dollars,

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
including a free drink.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
Well, call me when you get back home.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
Bye for now.

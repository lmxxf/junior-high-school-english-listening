Here we are. Welcome to Bay High Park. Wow, it's so quiet here that I can even hear

00:09.760 --> 00:14.840
the bird singing. I can hardly believe we're in the city centre.

00:14.840 --> 00:20.920
This park is famous for its lake, bridges and the ancient buildings on the hill. The

00:20.920 --> 00:27.200
lake takes up over half of the park area. Let's walk along the lake, cross the bridge and

00:27.200 --> 00:32.400
climb up the hill. Then I can point out the sites of Beijing for you.

00:32.400 --> 00:39.360
Yes, good idea. I'm sure it will be fantastic to see the city from the top.

00:39.360 --> 00:48.200
But I'm so tired. And it's so hot here. I don't want to climb. The lake looks nice and

00:48.200 --> 00:51.640
cool. Why don't we go for a swim?

00:51.640 --> 00:57.640
I don't think they allow people to swim in the lake. It's dangerous.

00:57.640 --> 01:05.400
That's too bad. Then why don't we have our picnic here? I'm so hungry and thirsty.

01:05.400 --> 01:09.240
I think it's better to have our picnic at the top of the hill.

01:09.240 --> 01:15.880
Come on. Let's not waste any more time. All right. I hope it will be cooler up there.

Dear Mom and Dad, I promise to write, so, we're staying with Ling Ling's uncle in Hunan province,

00:08.240 --> 00:15.680
and I'm having a wonderful time here in John Ja Ja. It's a magic land of mountains, forests,

00:15.680 --> 00:26.080
and rivers. It's very large, about 480 km2. It's famous for the strange shape of its tall rocks.

00:27.040 --> 00:31.360
Some of them look like humans, while others look like wild animals.

00:33.600 --> 00:41.760
Last night we camped by a small lake. During the night we heard a noise. It woke everybody up.

00:42.720 --> 00:48.160
We thought somebody was moving about. Ling Ling's uncle said it was an animal.

00:49.360 --> 00:55.360
We came out without making any noise, and found it was just a hungry monkey looking for food.

00:57.040 --> 01:02.880
This morning we climbed Mount Chienzu. From the top we hoped to see the lakes and forests,

01:03.520 --> 01:09.440
but it was a pity that it was cloudy. We could only see the mountain tops above the clouds.

01:10.480 --> 01:16.960
Then we walked down the path, along a river, past trees and other plants and back to the camp.

01:17.840 --> 01:24.320
I pulled a leaf off a plant, but Ling Ling's uncle said that it was wrong to pull leaves off plants,

01:24.400 --> 01:28.560
and that we should protect everything here. I was very sorry.

01:30.160 --> 01:36.000
Tomorrow we're going to Dong Tien Lake, the second largest freshwater lake in China.

01:36.800 --> 01:48.240
We'll be back home next week, wish you were here. Love Betty.

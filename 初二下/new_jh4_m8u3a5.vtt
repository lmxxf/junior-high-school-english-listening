00:00.000 --> 00:04.080
Mum, can I go on a holiday with my friends?

00:04.080 --> 00:06.120
Where are you going?

00:06.120 --> 00:08.880
We're going climbing in the mountains.

00:08.880 --> 00:11.080
Who are you going with?

00:11.080 --> 00:16.240
Well, Susan and Dave suggested that we join a group.

00:16.240 --> 00:19.200
There will be 15 people altogether.

00:19.200 --> 00:21.680
It sounds dangerous.

00:21.680 --> 00:23.920
Where are you going to sleep?

00:23.920 --> 00:26.600
What are you going to do about food?

00:26.600 --> 00:28.840
Will you be able to call me?

00:28.880 --> 00:30.680
Don't worry.

00:30.680 --> 00:33.080
We're going to camp out.

00:33.080 --> 00:35.480
We'll cook our own food,

00:35.480 --> 00:37.680
and I'll take my mobile phone.

00:37.680 --> 00:39.520
What about clothes?

00:39.520 --> 00:42.400
It's going to be cold in the mountains.

00:42.400 --> 00:45.400
I'll take lots of warm clothing.

00:45.400 --> 00:48.760
I'm worried that you'll fall and break your leg.

00:48.760 --> 00:50.760
Then what will you do?

00:50.760 --> 00:53.200
I'll stop worrying, Mum.

00:53.200 --> 00:55.400
Everything will be fine.

00:55.400 --> 00:56.880
Please can I go?

00:56.880 --> 00:58.440
Well,

00:58.480 --> 00:59.880
alright,

00:59.880 --> 01:01.840
but do be careful.

Hello.

00:01.000 --> 00:02.000
Hello.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
Could I speak to Betty, please?

00:04.000 --> 00:07.000
I'm sorry. She's not in at the moment.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
Is that Mrs. King?

00:09.000 --> 00:15.000
Yes. This is Betty's mother. Is it important? Can I take a message?

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
Yes, please. This is Ling Ling. Betty's classmate.

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
I have a problem with my best friend and I need her help.

00:25.000 --> 00:32.000
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, Ling Ling, but Betty is visiting her grandmother.

00:32.000 --> 00:39.000
She won't be back until tomorrow. Maybe you can try calling my friend, Jane.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
She works on the friendship helpline at school.

00:43.000 --> 00:48.000
Thanks so much, Mrs. King. May I have the number?

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
Yes, Mrs. King. May I have the number?

00:51.000 --> 00:58.000
You can call her on 58590808.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Thank you, Mrs. King.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
You're welcome, Ling Ling. I hope my friend can help you.

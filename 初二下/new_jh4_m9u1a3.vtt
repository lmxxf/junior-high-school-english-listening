Hello, friendship helpline. Who's calling please?

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
Hello, this is Ling Ling speaking.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
Hi Ling Ling, how can I help you?

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
I have a problem with my best friend. She's cool.

00:22.000 --> 00:28.000
No, don't tell me who she is. Tell me when the problem started.

00:28.000 --> 00:38.000
Yes, well, we've been friends for five years. We got separated when we went to different schools last term, but we stayed in touch.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
So could you explain what happened then?

00:42.000 --> 00:51.000
This term, she came to study at my school. I was so happy at first, but she's so different.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
Can you tell me how she's different?

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
She doesn't like me to see my other friends.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
Could I ask if you've mentioned this to her?

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
Yes, but she refused to listen.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
Okay, do you know why she treats you like that?

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
No, I don't know.

01:13.000 --> 01:19.000
Maybe she doesn't feel very sure of herself in her new school.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
Maybe.

01:21.000 --> 01:26.000
Try to find out whether she feels lonely without you.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
I'm sure she regrets hurting you.

01:29.000 --> 01:38.000
So be patient with her, and explain to her that she can make friends with your other friends too.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
Try to introduce her to them.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
I see. I'll encourage her to join in more. Thanks.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
No problem, Ling Ling. You're welcome.

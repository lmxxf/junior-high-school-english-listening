A beautiful smile by Zhang Be.

00:06.760 --> 00:12.520
When I was 13 years old, a girl gave me an important gift.

00:12.520 --> 00:15.440
It was a smile.

00:15.440 --> 00:20.680
It was the early autumn of my first year at a new school.

00:20.680 --> 00:22.880
No one knew me.

00:22.880 --> 00:28.320
I was very lonely and afraid to make friends with anyone.

00:28.320 --> 00:35.160
Every time I heard the other students talking and laughing, I felt even more lonely.

00:35.160 --> 00:40.920
I could not talk to anyone about my problem, and I did not want my parents to worry about

00:40.920 --> 00:42.920
me.

00:42.920 --> 00:49.920
One day, my classmates were talking with their friends, but I sat in silence.

00:49.920 --> 00:54.680
At that moment, a girl entered the classroom.

00:54.680 --> 00:57.720
I did not know who she was.

00:57.720 --> 01:01.800
She passed me and then turned back.

01:01.800 --> 01:07.680
She looked at me and, without a word, smiled.

01:07.680 --> 01:14.600
Suddenly, I felt the touch of something bright and friendly.

01:14.600 --> 01:19.560
It made me feel happy, lively and warm.

01:19.560 --> 01:23.880
It was like a hidden treasure.

01:23.880 --> 01:26.960
That smile changed my life.

01:26.960 --> 01:30.800
I started to talk with the other students.

01:30.800 --> 01:38.280
Day by day, I learnt to trust people, and they included me in their circle of friends.

01:38.280 --> 01:43.640
The girl with the bright smile has become my best friend now, and we stick together like

01:43.640 --> 01:44.880
glue.

01:44.880 --> 01:50.760
One day, I asked her why she smiled at me that day.

01:50.760 --> 01:53.720
She said she could not remember.

01:53.720 --> 01:57.360
Now I believe that the world is what you think it is.

01:57.360 --> 02:01.880
If you think you are lonely, you might always be alone.

02:01.880 --> 02:06.920
My suggestion is, smile at the world, and it will smile back.

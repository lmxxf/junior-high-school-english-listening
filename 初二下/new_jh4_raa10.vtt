00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Have you got a pet?

00:03.000 --> 00:06.000
Yes, I've got a very clever dog.

00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
Wow, how long have you had a dog?

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
You never talk about it.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
About two years?

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
He was a gift from my aunt for my birthday.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
Do you take your dog for a walk?

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
Yes, every evening after dinner.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
You know, my dog is very smart.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
He won first prize in a competition this year.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
Great. What was the competition?

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
Dog of the year.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
He won a special race.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
He jumped over lots of things and then swam across a small river.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
What was the prize?

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
A trip to Qing Dao with my dog.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
Fantastic.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
Do you have any pets, Betty?

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
Yes, I have a dog too.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
We can take our dogs for a walk together.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
What's a great idea?

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Look up at the sky.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
Look up at the sky.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
Bright white stars shining so high.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
I see them twinkle one by one,

00:13.000 --> 00:14.000
turning, turning around.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
When the dark night falls,

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
I stand and watch the soft white moon.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
Gravity keeps me standing on the ground

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
while the earth is spinning around.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Gravity keeps me standing on the ground

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
while the earth is spinning around.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
Look up at the sky.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
Bright white stars shining so high.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
I see them twinkle one by one,

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
turning, turning around.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
When the dark night falls,

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
I stand and watch the soft white moon.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
Gravity keeps me standing on the ground

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
while the earth is spinning around.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
Gravity keeps me standing on the ground

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
while the earth is spinning around.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Goodbye!

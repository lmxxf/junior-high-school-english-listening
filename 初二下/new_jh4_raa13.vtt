00:00.000 --> 00:04.880
Do you want to know more about the stars and planets?

00:04.880 --> 00:07.600
Would you like to make a model space station?

00:07.600 --> 00:13.040
Or would you like to visit the Science Museum to discover more about space?

00:13.040 --> 00:14.040
You would?

00:14.040 --> 00:18.000
Then join our school's new Space Club.

00:18.000 --> 00:23.120
At our first meeting we are going to learn about the moon and the planets.

00:23.120 --> 00:28.280
We have learnt something about them in our science lessons, but at the Space Club we

00:28.280 --> 00:31.600
are going to find out a lot more.

00:31.600 --> 00:37.160
We know that scientists have recently made new discoveries about several of the planets.

00:37.160 --> 00:43.640
Mr. Lu, our science teacher, has invited a famous scientist to come and talk to us about

00:43.640 --> 00:46.840
the latest space news.

00:46.840 --> 00:53.280
Our first meeting will be in the Science Lab on the first floor of the Science Building.

00:53.280 --> 00:57.080
The meeting is on Thursday at 5pm.

00:57.080 --> 01:04.520
First Mr. Lu will tell us about the different things that we are going to do at the club.

01:04.520 --> 01:09.600
And then at 5.30pm the talk will begin.

01:09.600 --> 01:13.760
There will be time for you to ask questions, so please think about what you would like

01:13.760 --> 01:15.440
to ask before you come.

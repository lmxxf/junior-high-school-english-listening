00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
At the seaside by Robert Louis Stevenson.

00:05.000 --> 00:09.000
When I was down beside the sea,

00:09.000 --> 00:14.000
I wouldn't say they gave to me to dig for the sandy shore.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
My holes were empty like a cup.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
In every hole the sea came up,

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
till it could come no more.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
When I was down beside the sea,

00:33.000 --> 00:39.000
I wouldn't say they gave to me to dig for the sandy shore.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
My holes were empty like a cup.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
In every hole the sea came up,

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
till it could come no more.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
When I was down beside the sea,

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
I wouldn't say they gave to me to dig for the sandy shore.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
My holes were empty like a cup.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
In every hole the sea came up,

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
till it could come no more.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
When I was down beside the sea,

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
I wouldn't say they gave to me to dig for the sandy shore.

00:00.000 --> 00:03.280
an introduction to Treasure Island.

00:05.000 --> 00:08.320
Treasure Island is a famous story.

00:08.840 --> 00:13.720
The hero, Jim Hawkins, finds Captain Flint's map.

00:14.560 --> 00:18.880
Captain Flint was a pirate and had lots of gold.

00:19.760 --> 00:23.000
He hid his gold before he died,

00:23.000 --> 00:27.400
and there is a cross on the map to show where the gold is.

00:28.400 --> 00:31.240
It is on an island in the Caribbean Sea.

00:32.400 --> 00:35.400
Jim and his friends buy a ship,

00:35.400 --> 00:40.400
get some men, and go to the island to look for the gold.

00:42.400 --> 00:44.400
They set sail,

00:44.400 --> 00:48.400
but then they discover that long John Silver, the cook,

00:48.400 --> 00:52.400
and the other men on the ship are all pirates.

00:53.400 --> 00:55.400
The pirates are planning to kill them.

00:56.400 --> 01:02.400
As soon as they get to the island, Jim and his friends fight the pirates.

01:02.400 --> 01:07.400
The pirates do not kill them, but take the map.

01:08.400 --> 01:13.400
The pirates go to look for the gold, and Jim follows them.

01:14.400 --> 01:18.400
Although they find the place, the gold is not there.

01:19.400 --> 01:24.400
Later, Jim knows it is because of Ben Gunn.

01:25.400 --> 01:28.400
Jim meets Ben Gunn on the island,

01:28.400 --> 01:32.400
and he tells Jim and his friends his story.

01:33.400 --> 01:38.400
He tells them he was a pirate, a friend of Captain Flint.

01:39.400 --> 01:42.400
He has now decided not to be a pirate.

01:43.400 --> 01:46.400
Ben Gunn found the gold sometime before.

01:47.400 --> 01:51.400
He agrees to share it with Jim and his friends,

01:51.400 --> 01:54.400
because they will take him back to England.

01:56.400 --> 02:00.400
When Jim and his friends leave the island, Ben goes with them.

02:01.400 --> 02:04.400
All of the pirates have to stay on the island,

02:04.400 --> 02:07.400
except long John Silver.

02:08.400 --> 02:13.400
Although he is also a pirate, he helps Jim and his friends.

02:14.400 --> 02:18.400
On their way home, they stop in America for one night.

02:19.400 --> 02:24.400
In the morning, they find that long John Silver has gone.

02:25.400 --> 02:28.400
And he has taken some of the gold.

02:29.400 --> 02:35.400
When they get back to England, Jim decides never to go looking for gold again.

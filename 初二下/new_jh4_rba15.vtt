00:00.000 --> 00:05.480
An introduction to Treasure Island.

00:05.480 --> 00:09.340
Treasure Island is a famous story.

00:09.340 --> 00:15.320
The hero, Jim Hawkins, finds Captain Flint's map.

00:15.320 --> 00:20.360
Captain Flint was a pirate and had lots of gold.

00:20.360 --> 00:26.920
He hid his gold before he died and there is a cross on the map to show where the gold

00:26.920 --> 00:29.000
is.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.040
It is on an island in the Caribbean Sea.

00:33.040 --> 00:43.000
Jim and his friends buy a ship, get some men and go to the island to look for the gold.

00:43.000 --> 00:50.160
They set sail, but then they discover that long John Silver, the cook and the other men

00:50.160 --> 00:53.800
on the ship are all pirates.

00:53.800 --> 00:57.200
The pirates are planning to kill them.

00:57.200 --> 01:03.440
As soon as they get to the island, Jim and his friends fight the pirates.

01:03.440 --> 01:09.360
The pirates do not kill them, but they take the map.

01:09.360 --> 01:15.400
The pirates go to look for the gold and Jim follows them.

01:15.400 --> 01:20.200
Although they find the place, the gold is not there.

01:20.200 --> 01:26.320
Later, Jim knows it is because of Ben Gun.

01:26.320 --> 01:34.240
Jim meets Ben Gun on the island and he tells Jim and his friends his story.

01:34.240 --> 01:39.880
He tells them he was a pirate, a friend of Captain Flint.

01:39.880 --> 01:44.000
He has now decided not to be a pirate.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.240
Ben Gun found the gold sometime before.

01:48.240 --> 01:54.960
He agrees to share it with Jim and his friends because they will take him back to England.

01:55.960 --> 02:01.960
When Jim and his friends leave the island, Ben goes with them.

02:01.960 --> 02:08.960
All of the pirates have to stay on the island except Long John Silver.

02:08.960 --> 02:14.960
Although he is also a pirate, he helps Jim and his friends.

02:14.960 --> 02:19.960
On their way home, they stop in America for one night.

02:20.960 --> 02:29.960
In the morning, they find that Long John Silver has gone and he has taken some of the gold.

02:29.960 --> 02:35.960
When they get back to England, Jim decides never to go looking for gold again.
